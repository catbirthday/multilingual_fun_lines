=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [regretful] I keep seeing their faces. The ones who, um... the ones who came to the meeting yesterday. [pause] This woman, she was probably seventy-something, and she just kept asking me how—how this could happen. [shaky voice] And I'm sitting there with my spreadsheets and my models, trying to explain that the fundamentals looked solid, the debt ratios were... [trailing off] God, who cares about the ratios now. [bitter] Twenty-three years of her husband's pension, gone. [very quietly] Because I said it was a strong buy. Because I thought I was so smart with my, uh... with my risk assessments. [frustrated] The thing is, we're trained to look at numbers, not faces. [sarcastic] "Maximize returns," they said. [very sad] But nobody tells you what it feels like when Mrs. Henderson says she can't afford her medication anymore. [crying while speaking] I ran the models fifty times. Checked everything. It was supposed to be—I mean, private equity is risky, but this was... [sniffle] this was people's lives. [angry] And my boss just says "unfortunate market conditions." [very melancholic] Unfortunate. [long pause] I don't think I can do this anymore.
