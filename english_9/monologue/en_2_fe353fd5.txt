=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp loudly] Oh my God. Oh my God, I just—I can't believe this is real. [shaky voice] Three point two million dollars. [pause] That's more than our entire operating budget for, what, the next four years? [laugh] I keep refreshing the bank statement like maybe I'm reading it wrong, but no, it's... it's actually there. [very excited] We can finally fix the roof! [laugh loudly] And the after-school program—oh man, we can expand it to all five schools now, not just two. [crying while speaking] I'm sorry, I just—all those kids we had to turn away last year because we didn't have the funding... [sniffle] God, I need to call Maria. [happy] She's going to lose her mind when she hears this. [pause] You know what's crazy? Yesterday I was literally lying awake thinking about, um... thinking about whether we'd even make it through the winter. [relieved] Like, I was calculating if we could delay the heating bill one more month. [long pause] And now... [warm] Now we can actually do what we came here to do. [very sincerely] Really help these families, not just—not just scrape by. [extremely happy] This changes everything!
