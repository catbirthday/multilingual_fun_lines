Subject: Finding out the consular officer position you've wanted for years went to someone with half your experience

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [confused] They gave it to Rebecca? [pause] Rebecca from the visa section who started, what, two years ago? [bitter] I've been working toward this for seven years. Seven. [sigh] I mean, I knew the interview didn't go perfectly, but I thought— [frustrated] God, I literally wrote the training manual for that position. [angry] How does someone with two years beat someone who's been doing the groundwork since 2017? [laugh] It's actually kind of funny, in a really depressing way. [sad] I trained her. [pause] I showed her how to process her first diplomatic visa. [very quietly] And now she's going to be my supervisor. [sarcastic] That's just fantastic. [groan] Maybe I came across as too eager? Or, um... maybe not eager enough? [anxious] What if they think I've peaked where I am? [shaky voice] That's what they think, isn't it? That I'm just the reliable workhorse who'll keep doing the same job forever. [bitter] While Rebecca gets to attend the conferences I've been requesting for years. [sigh] I don't even know if I can face her tomorrow. She'll want to celebrate, and I'll have to smile and say congratulations like I'm, uh... like I'm happy for her. [very sad] Mom always said good things come to those who wait. [pause] I'm tired of waiting. [resigned] Maybe it's time to look elsewhere.
