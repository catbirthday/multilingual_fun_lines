[sarcastic] The universe has a sick sense of humor, doesn't it? These hikers are trapped on that ridge after the avalanche, and suddenly everyone remembers what I used to do. [frustrated] I spent five years trying to convince people I'm just a normal guy now. [laugh] Normal. Right. But they're not wrong though. [slowly] I know exactly how to rappel down that cliff face in those conditions. Know how to rig the harnesses, secure the lines, work in, um... in zero visibility. [very quietly] Hell, I've done extractions in worse. Active firefights, sandstorms, you name it. [pause] Seven people up there. Families waiting. [determined] And the rescue teams, they're good, but they've never had to move that fast, that precise, when every second meant— [trailing off] [sigh] God, I thought I was done with this. [confidently] But if I'm the difference between those people making it home or not? [pause] Then I guess my past is, uh, finally good for something. [very sincerely] Time to dust off the old gear."
