=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] I found it. The packet logs, the redirected funds, everything. God, I've been staring at this screen for like... three hours now, just hoping I'm wrong somehow. [pause] But I'm not wrong. The timestamps match up perfectly with the missing pension deposits. They're literally routing money through dummy servers I helped configure. [bitter] Me. I built the infrastructure they're using to steal from people's retirement.

This company gave me everything, you know? When nobody else would hire me straight out of community college, they... they took a chance. [sigh] Mr. Chen personally mentored me. He'd stay late teaching me subnetting, and now I'm looking at evidence that he's been, um... that he's part of this whole thing.

[frustrated] What am I even supposed to do here? Like, if I report this, the company implodes. All those people lose their jobs. But if I don't... [pause] God, Mrs. Rodriguez in accounting, she's retiring next year. That's her money they're stealing.

[quietly] I keep thinking maybe there's an explanation I'm missing? But the data doesn't lie. Traffic patterns, encrypted transfers, offshore IPs—it's all there. [regretful] I guess I always knew something felt off about those late night "maintenance windows." Hm. Should've trusted my gut sooner.

[determined] I have to report it. Tomorrow morning. I'll make copies tonight, document everything.
