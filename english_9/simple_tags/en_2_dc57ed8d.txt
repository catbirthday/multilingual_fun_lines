Scenario: A reluctant janitor who accidentally saved the world from an alien invasion meets with a famous character designer who wants to turn his story into a video game protagonist.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [nervously] So, um, I still don't really understand why you need me here, like, I already told the story to the news people and the government folks and honestly it's getting kind of exhausting repeating how I accidentally activated that alien defense system with my mop bucket.

Character 2: [excited] That's exactly the problem though—everyone's telling your story except you, and they're getting it all wrong. [laughs] I mean, in the leaked military report, they said you were some kind of trained operative, not a night shift janitor who literally tripped into saving humanity.

Character 1: [confused] Yeah but that's, uh, that's kind of the whole point, right? Like I was just trying to clean up that weird glowing spill in the sub-basement, and then suddenly there's all these symbols floating around and I'm basically just pressing buttons hoping something would make it stop before my supervisor found out I'd broken something expensive.

Character 2: [warmly] See, that's what makes you perfect for this—the authenticity, the complete lack of traditional hero swagger. [chuckles] My whole career I've been designing these impossibly confident protagonists with perfect jawlines and mysterious pasts, but you're, well, you're refreshingly real.

Character 1: Refreshingly real is just a nice way of saying I have no idea what I'm doing, isn't it? [sighs]

Character 2: [playfully] Maybe, but that's exactly what players need right now—someone who succeeds despite being terrified, not because they're fearless. [pause] Plus, the way you used cleaning supplies as improvised weapons against those scout drones? Pure gaming gold.

Character 1: [embarrassed] Oh god, please don't put that part in, I mean, throwing industrial-strength floor wax at alien technology wasn't exactly strategic, it was more like, uhhhh, pure panic combined with whatever was within arm's reach.

Character 2: [enthusiastically] Are you kidding?

Character 1: [hesitantly] Look, I get that you're trying to make something entertaining here, but, um, people died during those three days, you know? Like, while I was fumbling around with alien interfaces, actual heroes were out there fighting, and I just, I don't want their sacrifice turned into some power-up or whatever.

Character 2: [sincerely] You're absolutely right, and that's why I need your input on this. [quietly] Every character I design carries responsibility—to the story, to the players, and in this case, to actual history. [clears throat] I promise we'll honor what really happened.

Character 1: [shaky voice] The thing is, everyone wants me to be proud of what I did, but honestly? I still have nightmares about those symbols, about accidentally triggering something that could've wiped out the planet instead of saving it.

Character 2: [gently] That's called survivor's guilt, and it's more common in real heroes than any game ever shows. [pause] What if we made that part of the character's journey—not just the physical challenge but the mental aftermath?

Character 1: [surprised] You'd actually include that? Like, not just the glory moments but also the part where I hid in a supply closet for two hours, crying and trying to call my mom even though the phones were down?

Character 2: [firmly] Especially that part, because that's what courage actually looks like—being terrified and doing it anyway. [laughs softly] Though we might need to workshop the supply closet scene for pacing reasons.

Character 1: [warming up] Okay, well, if we're being honest about everything, then you should probably know that the famous 'Janitor's Gambit' everyone keeps talking about wasn't some clever strategy—I literally just remembered this old arcade game pattern from when I was a kid, and somehow it matched the alien console sequence.

Character 2: [delighted] Wait, you're telling me you saved Earth using muscle memory from, what, Galaga? [laughs] Oh man, the forums are going to lose their minds when they find out the truth is nerdier than any fiction we could write.

Character 1: [laughing] It was actually Space Invaders, but yeah, basically twenty years of wasted quarters at the laundromat finally paid off. [sighs] Though I still feel weird about becoming some kind of character that kids will play as, you know?

Character 2: [thoughtfully] Think of it this way—you're giving them permission to be the unlikely hero in their own story. [warmly] Not everyone needs to be a space marine or a chosen one; sometimes the world just needs someone willing to pick up a mop and do their best.

Character 1: [quietly] When you put it like that, it actually sounds, um, kind of important. [pause] Okay, let's do this, but I have one condition—my character better have the same terrible posture and stress-eating habits, because if I'm going to be immortalized in pixels, it's going to be accurate.

Character 2: [grinning] Deal, though I'm definitely giving you a legendary skin where you're wearing that janitor uniform like armor. [chuckles] Trust me, by the time we're done, every player is going to understand that heroes come in all forms—even ones pushing mop buckets at three in the morning.
