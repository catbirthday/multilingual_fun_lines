Scenario: A film director watches helplessly from behind one-way glass as a focus group moderator leads a brutal feedback session about the director's passion project, before the two finally meet face-to-face afterward.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [formal] The demographic breakdown was exactly what you requested—eighteen to thirty-five, evenly split by gender, diverse backgrounds. [pause] Though I should mention, the responses were more uniformly negative than we typically see for this genre.

Character 2: I watched the whole thing from behind the glass. [quietly] Every uncomfortable shift, every glance at phones, every suppressed yawn during what I thought were the most powerful moments.

Character 1: [monotone] The third act scored particularly low on our engagement metrics. [clearing throat] Several participants used words like 'pretentious' and 'self-indulgent' when describing the dream sequences you spent six months filming in Iceland.

Character 2: [bitter] Those weren't just dream sequences, they were metaphorical representations of grief and memory intersecting with— [sighs] Never mind, you wouldn't understand what we were trying to accomplish there.

Character 1: [coldly] I understand perfectly well, Mr. Chen. [pause] I've moderated over three hundred screenings, and artistic intent rarely translates when audiences are checking their watches.

Character 2: [defensive] This film wasn't made for people who check their watches! [frustrated] It was made for anyone who's ever lost someone and felt that peculiar emptiness where love used to live.

Character 1: [stern] Your target audience is whoever the studio needs to buy tickets, and based on tonight's feedback, that audience found your film inaccessible. The score was forty-two out of one hundred.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Forty-two. [long pause] Three years of my life, my grandmother's story, everything I had to say about loss and connection, reduced to a number lower than most failing grades.

Character 1: [quietly] Forty-two, yes.

Character 2: [very quietly] I see.

Character 1: The studio will expect revisions.

Character 2: [exhausted] They always do, don't they? [sighs] Cut twenty minutes, add more dialogue, make the ending happier, explain everything twice for the people in the back.

Character 1: [matter-of-factly] Those changes consistently improve test scores by fifteen to twenty points. Your grandmother's story might actually reach people if you make it more accessible.

Character 2: [angry] My grandmother spent four years in a refugee camp, she didn't live an 'accessible' life! [trembling] Her story deserves to be told with the complexity and difficulty that honors her experience.

Character 1: [formal] I'm sure it does, but my job is to report audience reactions, not validate artistic choices. [pause] The written feedback forms are particularly harsh about the pacing.

Character 2: [resigned] Of course they are.

Character 1: [awkwardly] Look, off the record, I actually found the Iceland sequences quite moving. But that doesn't change what twenty-five strangers thought while eating free popcorn.

Character 2: [surprised] You found them moving? [hesitantly] Even the scene with the empty boat drifting through the ice, because everyone seemed to hate that one the most.

Character 1: [softly] My mother died last year. [pause] That empty boat, the way it kept floating despite having no one to steer it—I understood exactly what you were trying to say.

Character 2: [very quietly] Then you know why I can't change it. [sighs] You know why cutting those scenes would be like cutting out pieces of the people we've lost all over again.
