            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[warmly] I'm glad you did though, because honestly, we've interviewed twelve people and none of them have your level of experience with oncology coding. [sighs] The department is drowning without someone who understands the complexity of chemo administration billing."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[bitter] You know I specialized in oncology coding because of what happened with Mom, right? [pause] After everything fell apart between us, that work kept me grounded, gave me purpose when I had nothing else."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[regretful] I remember sitting with you in the hospital while she went through treatments, watching you take notes about every procedure code. [very quietly] That was before we lost ourselves in all the anger and accusations."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "The irony isn't lost on me that you're the one offering me this position now. [exhales] Five years ago you said I'd never amount to anything beyond data entry."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[apologetic] That was cruel and wrong, and I've regretted those words every single day since. [pause] Your resume speaks for itself—ninety-eight percent accuracy rate, zero compliance violations, three departmental excellence awards."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[shaky voice] This job would mean relocating back here, seeing you in meetings, pretending we're just colleagues. [sighs] I don't know if I can separate the professional from the personal like that."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[patiently] We'd mostly work in different buildings, and I could assign another coordinator to handle your onboarding if that helps. [clearing throat] The salary is seventy-five thousand with full benefits, and you'd be saving the cardiac unit from total chaos."

            "role": "Character 1",

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[slowly] The truth is I need this job, my current contract ends next month and there's nothing else remotely close to this level. [very quietly] But I need to know this won't become another battlefield between us."

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[relieved] Thank you for trusting me with this, I know it couldn't have been easy. [warmly] HR will send the formal offer tomorrow, and we can discuss start dates that work for your relocation timeline."

            "role": "Character 2",

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
