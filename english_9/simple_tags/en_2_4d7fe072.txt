Scenario: A law professor's former student, now a successful angel investor, returns to offer funding for the professor's struggling legal aid clinic, but with conditions that compromise its mission.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [formal] Michael, it's been what, twelve years since you sat in my Constitutional Law seminar? [pause] I appreciate you coming, though I'm not entirely sure why a venture capitalist wants to meet about our legal aid clinic.

Character 2: [warmly] Fourteen years, actually.

Character 1: [quietly] Right, fourteen.

Character 2: [confidently] Professor Chen, I've been following the clinic's work defending tenants against predatory landlords. [clears throat] My fund wants to invest two million dollars to expand your operations across the state.

Character 1: Two million? That's more than our entire operating budget for the next five years. [hesitantly] What exactly would you expect in return for this investment?

Character 2: [professionally] We'd want the clinic to prioritize cases with potential for class action suits, particularly against corporate landlords. The settlements could generate returns while still helping vulnerable populations.

Character 1: [stern] So you want us to cherry-pick cases based on profit potential rather than client need? [sighs] Mrs. Rodriguez with her black mold problem wouldn't qualify unless she had fifty neighbors to join her.

Character 2: [quickly] That's not what I'm saying. [pause] Look, the clinic is six months from closing without funding, and traditional grants have dried up completely.

Character 1: [bitter] I'm aware of our financial situation, Michael. [quietly] But turning justice into a revenue stream isn't the solution I had in mind when I started this place twenty-three years ago.

Character 2: [frustrated] With respect, Professor.

Character 1: You know what the real irony is here? [laughs] I used to lecture you about the moral obligations of the legal profession, about serving those who can't afford representation.

Character 2: [defensive] I remember every lecture, actually. That's why I'm here. [empathetically] This model could help thousands more people than the current system while ensuring the clinic's survival.

Character 1: [very quietly] The current system. You mean the one where we take every case that walks through our door, regardless of its settlement value? Where my students learn that law is about service, not transactions?

Character 2: Those students won't learn anything if the clinic shuts down. [firmly] Sometimes ideological purity is a luxury, Professor Chen, and right now you can't afford luxuries.

Character 1: [coldly] I see you've learned the language of compromise quite fluently in Silicon Valley. [pause] Tell me, do you still remember the oath you took when you passed the bar?

Character 2: [very quietly] I never practiced law. [sighs] Went straight into venture capital after graduation, you knew that.

Character 1: [regretful] Yes, I knew. [slowly] I just hoped that somewhere beneath the term sheets and equity stakes, that idealistic student who wrote about access to justice might still exist.

Character 2: [sincerely] He does.

Character 1: [exhausted] Then why are you asking me to auction off everything this clinic represents? [very quietly] We don't just provide legal services, Michael, we provide hope to people who have none.

Character 2: [softly] Because hope without resources is just false promise. [pause] Take the weekend to think about it, but Professor, the offer expires Monday morning.
