Scenario: A recruiting coordinator must interview and potentially hire their ex-spouse from a bitter divorce five years ago, who happens to be the only qualified medical coder for a critical hospital position.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] So, thank you for coming in today for this interview, I know it must be as awkward for you as it is for me. [pause] The hospital desperately needs someone with your exact skillset, your certifications in both ICD-10 and CPT coding.

Character 2: [very quietly] I almost didn't come.

Character 1: [warmly] I'm glad you did though, because honestly, we've interviewed twelve people and none of them have your level of experience with oncology coding. [sighs] The department is drowning without someone who understands the complexity of chemo administration billing.

Character 2: [bitter] You know I specialized in oncology coding because of what happened with Mom, right? [pause] After everything fell apart between us, that work kept me grounded, gave me purpose when I had nothing else.

Character 1: [regretful] I remember sitting with you in the hospital while she went through treatments, watching you take notes about every procedure code. [very quietly] That was before we lost ourselves in all the anger and accusations.

Character 2: The irony isn't lost on me that you're the one offering me this position now. [exhales] Five years ago you said I'd never amount to anything beyond data entry.

Character 1: [apologetic] That was cruel and wrong, and I've regretted those words every single day since. [pause] Your resume speaks for itself—ninety-eight percent accuracy rate, zero compliance violations, three departmental excellence awards.

Character 2: [shaky voice] This job would mean relocating back here, seeing you in meetings, pretending we're just colleagues. [sighs] I don't know if I can separate the professional from the personal like that.

Character 1: [patiently] We'd mostly work in different buildings, and I could assign another coordinator to handle your onboarding if that helps. [clearing throat] The salary is seventy-five thousand with full benefits, and you'd be saving the cardiac unit from total chaos.

Character 2: [hesitantly] You always knew how to appeal to my need to fix broken systems. [laughs] Remember when I reorganized your entire filing system during our first year together?

Character 1: [chuckle] Still use it.

Character 2: [surprised] Really? Even after everything? [pause] I figured you would have burned anything that reminded you of me, including my color-coded organizational charts.

Character 1: [sincerely] Some things are worth keeping regardless of how they ended. [sighs] Your system saved me hours every week, and honestly, it reminds me that we weren't always at each other's throats.

Character 2: [slowly] The truth is I need this job, my current contract ends next month and there's nothing else remotely close to this level. [very quietly] But I need to know this won't become another battlefield between us.

Character 1: [firmly] I promise to keep things professional, to treat you with the respect you deserve as our lead coder. [pause] What happened between us personally doesn't change the fact that you're brilliant at what you do.

Character 2: [exhales] Alright, I'll take it, but we need clear boundaries from day one. [hesitantly] Maybe this is our chance to prove we've both grown up since the divorce.

Character 1: [relieved] Thank you for trusting me with this, I know it couldn't have been easy. [warmly] HR will send the formal offer tomorrow, and we can discuss start dates that work for your relocation timeline.

Character 2: [softly] You know what's strange? This conversation has been more civil than our last three years of marriage. [sighs] Maybe distance and time really do heal some wounds.

Character 1: [very quietly] Maybe they do, or maybe we just finally learned how to listen to each other without trying to win. [pause] Either way, welcome to the team.

Character 2: [smiling speaking] Thanks, boss.
