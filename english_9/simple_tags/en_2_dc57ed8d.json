[laughs] I mean, in the leaked military report, they said you were some kind of trained operative, not a night shift janitor who literally tripped into saving humanity."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[confused] Yeah but that's, uh, that's kind of the whole point, right? Like I was just trying to clean up that weird glowing spill in the sub-basement, and then suddenly there's all these symbols floating around and I'm basically just pressing buttons hoping something would make it stop before my supervisor found out I'd broken something expensive."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[warmly] See, that's what makes you perfect for this—the authenticity, the complete lack of traditional hero swagger. [chuckles] My whole career I've been designing these impossibly confident protagonists with perfect jawlines and mysterious pasts, but you're, well, you're refreshingly real."

            "role": "Character 1",

            "content": "[playfully] Maybe, but that's exactly what players need right now—someone who succeeds despite being terrified, not because they're fearless. [pause] Plus, the way you used cleaning supplies as improvised weapons against those scout drones? Pure gaming gold."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[gently] That's called survivor's guilt, and it's more common in real heroes than any game ever shows. [pause] What if we made that part of the character's journey—not just the physical challenge but the mental aftermath?"

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[surprised] You'd actually include that? Like, not just the glory moments but also the part where I hid in a supply closet for two hours, crying and trying to call my mom even though the phones were down?"

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[firmly] Especially that part, because that's what courage actually looks like—being terrified and doing it anyway. [laughs softly] Though we might need to workshop the supply closet scene for pacing reasons."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[warming up] Okay, well, if we're being honest about everything, then you should probably know that the famous 'Janitor's Gambit' everyone keeps talking about wasn't some clever strategy—I literally just remembered this old arcade game pattern from when I was a kid, and somehow it matched the alien console sequence."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 1",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[thoughtfully] Think of it this way—you're giving them permission to be the unlikely hero in their own story. [warmly] Not everyone needs to be a space marine or a chosen one; sometimes the world just needs someone willing to pick up a mop and do their best."

[pause] Okay, let's do this, but I have one condition—my character better have the same terrible posture and stress-eating habits, because if I'm going to be immortalized in pixels, it's going to be accurate."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[grinning] Deal, though I'm definitely giving you a legendary skin where you're wearing that janitor uniform like armor. [chuckles] Trust me, by the time we're done, every player is going to understand that heroes come in all forms—even ones pushing mop buckets at three in the morning."
