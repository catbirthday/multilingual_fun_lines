Scenario: A wealthy land baron discovers their estranged child working as a produce clerk at a grocery store after years of searching.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shaky voice] Emma, it's really you standing here weighing apples in this grocery store after all these years. [pause] I've had investigators searching three states, and here you were twenty minutes from the estate.

Character 2: The name's Alex now, and I need you to step back from my station before my manager notices. These organic honeycrisps need to be sorted by four o'clock.

Character 1: [desperately] You just disappeared that night after the argument about the development project. [very quietly] Your mother cried herself to sleep for months, wondering if you were even alive.

Character 2: [bitter] She cried about losing her heir, not her child. [coldly] Both of you only ever saw me as an extension of your land empire, another asset to manage and develop.

Character 1: [pleading] That's not true, we wanted you to have everything we never had growing up. [sighs] The properties, the education, the connections—it was all supposed to be yours someday.

Character 2: [monotone] I stack produce for eight dollars an hour, share a studio apartment with two roommates, and eat the bruised fruit nobody else wants. [firmly] This life is more honest than anything you offered.

Character 1: [quietly] I've kept your room exactly as you left it, even that ridiculous band poster you loved. [pause] The trust fund still has your name on it, untouched, accumulating interest.

Character 2: Money from displacing families, from turning farmland into strip malls, from choosing profit over people every single time. [exhales] I'd rather earn minimum wage than touch those accounts.

Character 1: [defeated] Your grandfather built that company from nothing, worked himself into an early grave establishing something to pass down. [very quietly] Now I'm seventy-three with no one to leave it to.

Character 2: Maybe you should have thought about that before bulldozing the Martinez family orchards where three generations lived. They shop here now, can barely afford groceries.

Character 1: [whispering] I know I made mistakes, terrible choices that hurt people. [clearing throat] But losing you was the only consequence that actually taught me anything about what matters.

Character 2: [exhausted] It's been six years, Dad. [sighs] Six years of building a life without your shadow, without feeling guilty for not wanting to be you.

Character 1: [anxious] Just have dinner with us, one meal, let your mother see you're okay. [quickly] After that, if you want us to leave you alone forever, we will.

Character 2: She sent you here alone, didn't she? Too proud to walk into a grocery store herself, too afraid I'd reject her in public.

Character 1: [very meekly] She's in the car outside, has been for two hours working up the courage. [pause] Diabetes took most of her eyesight last year, but she insisted on coming anyway.

Character 2: [very quietly] She's blind now? [long pause] Nobody told me, I didn't know she was sick, I would have—no, it doesn't change anything.

Character 1: [gently] It changes that she can't see the disappointment in your eyes anymore. [sighs] Maybe that's the only reason she's brave enough to try this.

Character 2: [shaky voice] My shift ends at five-thirty, and there's a diner two blocks north that serves her favorite pie. [very quietly] One hour, that's all you get.

Character 1: [relieved] One hour is more than I dared hope for after all this time. [warmly] Thank you, Emma—I mean Alex, thank you for giving us even that.

Character 2: [firmly] One hour. [pause] That's it.
