=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [hesitantly] So, um, I've been looking at your books for the past hour and, honestly, the numbers are worse than what you told me on the phone. [pause] But there's something else happening here that I think we should probably talk about first.

Character 2: [defensively] Look, if you're going to tell me to close down like the last three consultants did, you can just save your breath, okay? [quietly] This place is all Maya and I have left of her mother, so that's not happening.

Character 1: [gently] Maya's the teenager I saw in the kitchen when I came in, right? [carefully] She mentioned something about not going back to school next semester, said you needed her here full-time to keep things running.

Character 2: [shaky voice] She shouldn't have told you that, it's not—we haven't decided anything yet. [sighs] Every morning she gets up at four-thirty to prep before school, then comes straight back to work dinner service until midnight.

Character 1: That's not sustainable.

Character 2: You think I don't know that? [bitter] But what am I supposed to do, hmm? Let her mother's restaurant die while she watches? Tell her that her education matters more than keeping a roof over our heads?

Character 1: [firmly] There are other options here, restructuring the debt, maybe bringing in a partner, even pivoting the business model—I mean, have you considered any of those? [pause] Your sister wouldn't want Maya sacrificing her future for this place.

Character 2: Don't you dare—[trails off]

Character 1: [softly] I'm sorry, that was, uh, that was out of line. [quietly] But I've seen this before, families destroying themselves trying to save businesses that are already gone, and it never ends well for anyone involved.

Character 2: [exhausted] Six months ago I was just the uncle who showed up for birthdays with twenty dollar bills and bad jokes, you know? [very quietly] Now I'm supposed to know how to raise a grieving teenager while keeping forty years of family history from bankruptcy.

Character 1: [warmly] Nobody's prepared for something like that, losing a sister and becoming a parent in the same moment. [thoughtfully] But maybe that's actually your answer here—this doesn't have to be the same restaurant it was under your sister.

Character 2: [confused] What are you saying exactly? Because if you're suggesting some trendy rebrand with, I don't know, small plates and craft cocktails, that's not who we are. [frustrated] My sister's recipes, her grandmother's recipes, that's what people come here for.

Character 1: [quickly] No, no, I'm talking about something different—keeping the soul but changing the structure. What if Maya could be involved without dropping out? [excited] Like a junior apprenticeship program through her school, getting credit while she learns the business properly.

Character 2: [skeptical] Schools don't just let kids work instead of attending classes, and even if they did, it doesn't solve the money problem. [sighs] We're three months behind on rent and the equipment's falling apart faster than I can YouTube how to fix it.

Character 1: [confidently] Actually, there's a vocational program specifically for family businesses in crisis, it's, um, it's new but I helped write the grant proposal. [speaking fast] Maya could get school credit, you'd get a subsidized assistant manager, and there's emergency funding for legacy restaurants.

Character 2: [very quietly] Why would you—why are you really here? [pause] This isn't just another consultation, is it? You're not charging me your usual rate, you're offering solutions I've never heard of, so what's actually going on?

Character 1: [slowly] Your sister called me two weeks before the accident, said she wanted help setting up a college fund for Maya through the business. [shaky voice] We were supposed to meet that Monday to sign the paperwork, but she, uh, she never made it.

Character 2: [barely audible] Oh god, she was—[crying while speaking] she was always thinking ahead, always worried about Maya's future even when everything was falling apart. [sniffles] I found her journal with five-year plans, ten-year plans, all for Maya.

Character 1: [gently] So let me help you both, okay? Not as a consultant but as someone who made a promise to your sister that I couldn't keep. [determined] We're going to save this place and Maya's future, even if I have to call in every favor I have.

Character 2: [relieved] I don't even know what to say, I mean, I've been drowning here for months thinking I was completely alone in this. [warmly] Thank you for telling me about her call, for not just walking away when she couldn't make that meeting.
