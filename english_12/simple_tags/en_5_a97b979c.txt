Scenario: A street sweeper operator encounters their nephew selling drugs on the corner they're about to clean, forcing a confrontation about the path he's chosen.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: What the hell are you doing here, Marcus? Get off this corner right now before I, uh, before I have to sweep around whatever mess you're making.

Character 2: [defensive] Just standing here talking to friends, Uncle Ray. [coughs] Last I checked that wasn't illegal, and you're not a cop anyway, you just clean the streets.

Character 1: [angry] Don't play dumb with me, I saw the handoff from half a block away. [pause] Your mother thinks you're at community college right now, studying for your finals or whatever.

Character 2: [bitter] Yeah well, community college doesn't pay for Mom's medication, does it? [quietly] You know how much her prescriptions cost every month? Three hundred dollars we don't have.

Character 1: [frustrated] So this is your solution? Standing on corners like some, some stereotype? [sighs] Twenty years I've been cleaning these streets, watching kids like you throw their lives away for quick cash.

Character 2: [impatient] Kids like me? [laughs] You mean kids trying to keep their families from getting evicted? Sorry we can't all be satisfied with minimum wage and a city pension, Uncle.

Character 1: At least I can look your grandmother in the eye at Sunday dinner without lying about where my money comes from, you understand what I'm saying?

Character 2: [curt] Grandma's dead, remember? [pause] Has been for two years, but you'd know that if you actually came around instead of just preaching at us when it's convenient.

Character 1: [shaky voice] I meant... look, that's not the point here. The point is you're better than this, Marcus. [exhales] Your dad would be rolling in his grave seeing you out here like this.

Character 2: [angry] Don't you dare bring up my father! [voice breaking] He worked himself to death in that warehouse for pennies while people like his bosses got rich off his labor.

Character 1: [firmly] He worked honest though, kept his dignity intact. [sighs] That means something, or at least it used to mean something to this family before everything went to hell.

Character 2: [bitterly] Dignity doesn't keep the lights on, Uncle Ray. [pause] But hey, you keep pushing that broom and telling yourself you're morally superior while we lose the apartment next month.

Character 1: [desperate] Then come work with me! The city's hiring, I can get you in, benefits and everything. It's not glamorous but it's steady, it's real work, legitimate work that won't land you in prison.

Character 2: [sarcastically] Forty hours a week for what you make? [laughs bitterly] I make that in two days out here, sometimes three if it's slow, and nobody's breathing down my neck about attendance.

Character 1: You make that until you're dead or locked up, which at this rate will be what, six months? A year if you're lucky?

Character 2: [quietly] Maybe. [pause] But Mom gets her medicine this month, and that's all I'm thinking about right now, not some hypothetical future where everything magically works out.

Character 1: [exhausted] I've got two hundred in my truck, take it and get off this corner. [sighs] Tell your boys you're done for the day, family emergency or something, I don't care what.

Character 2: [surprised] I don't need your money, Uncle. [defensive] I'm not some charity case you can just throw cash at to make yourself feel better about abandoning us.

Character 1: Take the damn money!

Character 2: [resigned] Fine. [long pause] But this doesn't change anything, you know that right? Tomorrow I'll be right back here because your two hundred dollars lasts exactly five days in our world.
