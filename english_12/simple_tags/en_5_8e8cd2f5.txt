Scenario: A tribute artist performing as Elvis discovers the gas fitter working on her venue's heating system is her estranged father who abandoned the family twenty years ago.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Dad? Is that—is that actually you under that venue maintenance uniform, or am I just, um, seeing things because I haven't slept in two days preparing for tonight's show?

Character 2: [very quietly] Hello, Marie. [clearing throat] Yeah, it's me. I, uh, I didn't know you were performing here tonight, they just said there was a heating issue in the main theater that needed immediate attention.

Character 1: [bitter] Twenty years, Dad. Twenty goddamn years of nothing, and you just happen to show up here fixing the heat on the biggest night of my tribute career? [laughs] That's either cosmic irony or you knew exactly what you were doing.

Character 2: I've been working this venue for three months now, had no idea you were, well, doing this Elvis thing professionally. [pause] Your mother never mentioned it in her letters before she stopped writing them.

Character 1: [shaky voice] She stopped writing because she died, Dad. [exhales] Two years ago, cancer, and I had to explain to everyone at the funeral why her husband wasn't there, why he hadn't been there for two decades.

Character 2: [regretful] I know about the cancer, Marie. I, uh, I tried to come back when I heard she was sick, but she told me to stay away, said you'd built a life without me and it would just make things harder. [sighs]

Character 1: [crying while speaking] You believed her? You just took that as permission to stay gone? God, I spent years defending you to her, telling her you must have had your reasons, that maybe you'd come back when you were ready.

Character 2: [very quietly] I wasn't ready. Still not.

Character 1: [frustrated] You know what's funny? I sing 'Can't Help Falling in Love' every night, and all I can think about is how you helped me practice it for the school talent show right before you left. [voice breaking] Was that goodbye?

Character 2: [warmly] You were so nervous that night, kept forgetting the second verse. [chuckles] I told you to just feel the music, let Elvis guide you through it, and you, um, you lit up that stage like you were born to it.

Character 1: [softly] You remember that?

Character 2: [hesitantly] I've actually, uh, seen you perform three times this year. [pause] Different venues, always from the back, always leaving before the lights come up, but yeah, I've been watching you become everything you dreamed about.

Character 1: [confused] Wait, you've been following my career? Why wouldn't you just, I don't know, say something, reach out, send a damn text message like a normal person who wants to reconnect?

Character 2: [defensively] Because what do you say after twenty years? 'Hey, sorry I missed your graduation, your wedding, your divorce, your mother's death, but great Elvis costume'? [sighs] Some things are too broken to fix with words.

Character 1: [quietly] Maybe. But you're here now, and the heating's broken, which seems, um, weirdly appropriate given how cold things have been between us all these years. [nervous laugh]

Character 2: [gently] The heating system's actually an easy fix, just a faulty thermocouple that needs replacing. [pause] Takes about thirty minutes if you know what you're doing, which, well, after twenty years in the trade, I do.

Character 1: [carefully] Thirty minutes, huh? That's, uh, that's about how long I have before I need to get into costume. Maybe you could, I don't know, tell me about those other shows you saw while you work? [trailing off]

Character 2: [warmly] The one in Sacramento, you changed the arrangement on 'Suspicious Minds' and it was brilliant. [chuckles softly] Made it your own while still honoring what Elvis would have wanted, that takes real artistry.

Character 1: [emotional] I can't do this, Dad. I can't just chat about my performances like you're some fan who hasn't destroyed me. [pause] But I also can't let you leave again without trying to understand why.

Character 2: After the show tonight, there's a twenty-four hour diner two blocks north where I usually grab coffee when I work late venues. [very quietly] I'll be there until sunrise if you want to, um, if you want to talk about the why.
