        {
            "role": "Character 2",

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[gently] The heating system's actually an easy fix, just a faulty thermocouple that needs replacing. [pause] Takes about thirty minutes if you know what you're doing, which, well, after twenty years in the trade, I do."

            "role": "Character 1",
