Scenario: A career counselor realizes during a session that their client is the same 'friend' who sabotaged their own career years ago while pretending to be supportive.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confused] Wait, I recognize that nervous habit with your ring—you always twist it counterclockwise when you're about to lie. [pause] Rebecca? Rebecca Thornton from Marks & Associates?

Character 2: [hesitantly] Oh my god, Sandra! [nervous laugh] I didn't realize you'd become a career counselor after everything that happened at the firm.

Character 1: [bitter] After everything that happened? [coldly] You mean after you told the partners I was interviewing with competitors while secretly applying for my promotion yourself?

Character 2: [quickly] That's not exactly how it went down, and you know the partners were already questioning your commitment when you took those mental health days. [defensive] I was just being honest about what I observed.

Character 1: [firmly] Honest? [laugh] You literally edited my presentation slides the night before the client pitch to make yourself look better. I found the version history, Rebecca.

Character 2: [mumbling] I improved them.

Character 1: [sarcastically] Right, improved.

Character 2: [frustrated] Look, it was a competitive environment and we all did what we had to do to survive. [sighs] That's actually why I'm here—karma caught up and now I'm the one who got pushed out.

Character 1: [very quietly] So you want career advice from the person whose career you deliberately sabotaged? [pause] The irony is absolutely breathtaking, even for you.

Character 2: [regretful] I know how this looks, okay? [quietly] But you're the best counselor in the city now, everyone says so, and I genuinely need help rebuilding after what happened to me at Morrison Tech.

Character 1: [curious] Morrison Tech? [chuckle] Let me guess—someone younger and hungrier played your own game against you, copied your tactics, maybe even perfected them?

Character 2: [very quietly] They recorded me badmouthing the CEO at happy hour and anonymously sent it to the board. [bitter] Three weeks later I was escorted out by security with a cardboard box.

Character 1: [empathetically] Part of me wants to say you deserved it, but watching anyone go through that kind of humiliation—[sighs] it's brutal, even when there's poetic justice involved.

Character 2: I get it if you want me to leave.

Character 1: [firmly] No, sit down.

Character 2: [confused] What? Why would you help me after everything? I destroyed your trajectory at Marks, and we both know you would've made partner by now.

Character 1: [warmly] Because I'm a professional, and because the best revenge isn't refusing to help you. [pause] It's showing you what actual integrity looks like while you're at your lowest point.

Character 2: [shaky voice] I don't deserve this kindness, Sandra. [crying while speaking] I've been carrying the guilt for five years, telling myself it was just business, but seeing you now, successful despite what I did—

Character 1: [stern] Stop. [coldly] This isn't about kindness or forgiveness, Rebecca—it's about me being better at my job than you ever were at yours. Now, let's discuss your skill gaps.

Character 2: [very meekly] Okay, yes, let's do that. [pause] I'm ready to actually listen this time, to someone who clearly knows how to build something real instead of just tearing others down.
