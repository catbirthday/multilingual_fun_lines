Scenario: A college athlete confronts their roommate after discovering they've been secretly recording and selling private conversations with teammates to a sports betting syndicate.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [calmly] So you found my recordings.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Three months of locker room conversations, team strategies, even Coach Miller's personal calls about who's getting benched. [louder] You sold us out to gamblers for what, a few thousand dollars?

Character 1: [amused] Thirty-seven thousand, actually.

Character 2: [furious] My scholarship is on the line because of those bets! [voice rising] Tommy got suspended because someone knew exactly when he'd fail that drug test, and that was you feeding them information!

Character 1: [confidently] Tommy was always going to fail that test because Tommy can't stay clean for more than two weeks. [chuckles] I just helped some people profit from the inevitable.

Character 2: [frustrated] We trusted you, man, we let you into our space, into our lives. [quieter] You came to team dinners, you pretended to care about our wins and losses.

Character 1: [dismissively] Pretended is a strong word. [pause] I found your victories entertaining in the same way someone might enjoy watching ants build a colony—fascinating but ultimately meaningless.

Character 2: [anxious] The FBI is investigating point-shaving in college sports right now, and when they find those recordings, when they trace the money back to you, we're all going down. [gasps] Do you even understand what you've done?

Character 1: [overly polite] Oh, I understand perfectly, which is why the recordings are encrypted and routed through servers in three different countries. [slowly] The money's already been converted to cryptocurrency and dispersed across multiple wallets.

Character 2: You planned this from the beginning, from the day you moved into our suite, didn't you?

Character 1: [warmly] Of course I did, though I'll admit you all exceeded my profit expectations. [sighs] Athletes are surprisingly predictable when you study their patterns—injury cycles, performance anxiety, substance abuse tendencies.

Character 2: [bitter] You're sick.

Character 1: [cheerful] That's what my last therapist said before I convinced her to violate patient confidentiality and lose her license. [laughs] People always resort to medical terminology when they can't comprehend someone operating outside their moral framework.

Character 2: [desperate] I could go to the police right now, tell them everything, show them the equipment you've been using. [firmly] Maybe I can't prove the gambling connection, but unauthorized recording is still a felony.

Character 1: [condescending] You could, but then I'd have to share those fascinating videos from spring break in Cancun—you remember, the ones with the congressman's daughter? [clearing throat] Your NFL dreams would evaporate faster than your father's respect.

Character 2: [very quietly] You recorded that too? [gasps softly] She was drunk, we were all drunk, nothing even happened between us.

Character 1: [mocking] Context is such a fragile thing in the age of social media. [slowly] A few edited clips, some suggestive captions, and suddenly you're the predator who ruined America's sweetheart.

Character 2: [defeated] What do you want?

Character 1: [playful] Nothing from you anymore, actually, I'm transferring to Stanford next semester to pursue more lucrative opportunities. [pause] Just needed you to understand that your silence isn't optional—it's the only move you have left.

Character 2: [angry] One day someone's going to see through your act, someone smarter than a bunch of college athletes, and when they do, when you finally face consequences, I hope you remember this moment. [trailing off]
