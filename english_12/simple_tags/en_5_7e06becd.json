            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[firmly] I understand it's damaged, but the family specifically requested we bring it to the best luthier in the state. [pause] They know you worked on Elena Vasquez's instruments before, and they're willing to pay whatever it takes."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[bitter] Money can't resurrect dead wood any more than it can resurrect dead cellists. [exhales] This instrument drowned with her, and pretending otherwise is just cruel to everyone involved."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[practically] Look, I pulled her body from that yacht myself, spent six hours in those waves searching for survivors. Her daughter needs something tangible to hold onto, even if it's just pieces of what used to be."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[softer] Fourteen years old, plays violin herself apparently. [clears throat] She keeps asking if her mother's cello suffered, if it felt anything when the water came in. I don't know what to tell her."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "Instruments don't feel pain, but they do hold memory in every grain of wood, every layer of varnish applied by caring hands. [very quietly] Maybe I could salvage the scroll, mount it somehow, preserve the part her mother's hands touched most."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[frustrated] That's something at least. [sighs] You know, I've recovered dozens of valuables from wrecks, but this one feels different somehow. The way it was still in its case, latched tight like she was protecting it even as the boat went down."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[shaky voice] Elena always treated her instruments like living things. She once told me that a cello without a player is just furniture with strings, but together they become one voice. [pause] God, I can't believe she's really gone."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[awkwardly] You knew her well then. The reports just said she was a passenger, but the yacht captain mentioned she was supposed to perform at some festival in Martha's Vineyard."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[increasingly emotional] The Vineyard Chamber Music Festival, yes. I was actually finishing a new bow for her to use there, Brazilian pernambuco with mother-of-pearl inlay. [voice breaking] It's still sitting in my workshop, waiting for her to pick it up."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[practically] The bow might mean something to the daughter too. These things, the tangible pieces left behind, they help with the grieving process. [pause] Trust me, I've delivered enough of them to know."

            "role": "Character 1",

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[firmly] Because someone has to. [quietly] And sometimes, rarely, we pull out survivors instead of bodies, and that makes all the death notifications bearable."
        },
        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[bitterly] But not this time. This time it's just me trying to resurrect splinters of wood while a fourteen-year-old girl asks if her mother's cello suffered. [sighs heavily] Jesus Christ, what a world."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[defensively] We did everything we could. The storm came out of nowhere, and by the time the mayday came through, they were already taking on water. [speeding up] Fifteen-foot swells, forty-knot winds, visibility near zero."

        {
            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[exhausted] I'm not blaming you, officer. [long pause] I'm blaming the universe for taking someone who could make a cello sound like it was crying real tears, while leaving the rest of us here with the wreckage."

        {
            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[gently] Her daughter has her mother's hands, apparently. Long fingers, perfect for strings. Maybe you could help her, teach her about maintaining instruments, give her something to focus on besides the loss."

            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[warming slightly] Maybe. Though I suspect she'll want nothing to do with music for a while. [very quietly] Grief has a way of poisoning the things we used to love, turning comfort into reminder of absence."

            "role": "Character 2",
