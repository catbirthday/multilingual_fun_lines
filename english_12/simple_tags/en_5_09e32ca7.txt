Scenario: A workers comp investigator arrives at a music store to investigate a keyboard technician's claim that an amplifier explosion damaged their perfect pitch ability.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [formal] Mr. Chen, I'm here to investigate your workers compensation claim regarding the amplifier explosion that allegedly damaged your perfect pitch. [pause] The insurance company needs verification of this rather unique injury.

Character 2: [frustrated] Unique? [bitter] Do you know what it's like to hear every note a quarter-tone flat after twenty years of tuning concert pianos? My entire career depends on distinguishing between 440 and 441 hertz.

Character 1: [stern] The medical reports show no physical damage to your eardrums or cochlear structures. [quickly] How exactly does an amplifier explosion cause selective pitch distortion without any measurable hearing loss?

Character 2: [passionately] Perfect pitch isn't just physical hearing—it's neurological processing! [loudly] That blast rewired something in my auditory cortex, and now every Steinway I touch sounds like it's been left in the rain for a decade.

Character 1: [curious] You filed for total disability, claiming you can't work at all. [pause] But I have surveillance footage of you tuning the church organ on Maple Street just last Sunday.

Character 2: [defensive] That was volunteer work for my mother's funeral service! [very quietly] I had to use an electronic tuner for the first time in my life because I couldn't trust my ears anymore.

Character 1: [empathetically] I'm sorry about your mother. [formal] However, the claim states you were standing fifteen feet from the amplifier when it exploded, but your coworker says you were in the storage room.

Character 2: [angry] Marcus never liked me because I could tune by ear while he needed his precious machines! [exhales] He probably didn't even see where I was when those capacitors blew and sent that sonic wave through the showroom.

Character 1: The store's electrical inspection records show those amplifiers were rated for the voltage they received. [stern] There's no evidence of any power surge or equipment failure that day.

Character 2: [shaky voice] You think I'm making this up? [passionate] I've lost three clients this month because their pianos sound perfect to everyone else but wrong to me—my reputation is crumbling!

Character 1: [quietly] The security footage does show you covering your ears and stumbling after the explosion. [hesitantly] But it also shows you returning to work normally for two weeks before filing this claim.

Character 2: I thought it would get better! [frustrated] Every morning I'd test myself with tuning forks, hoping my brain would recalibrate, but it only got worse as I realized the damage was permanent.

Character 1: [warm] Have you considered that this might be psychological? [gently] Trauma from the explosion combined with the stress of your mother's illness could manifest as auditory processing changes.

Character 2: [bitter] Psychological? [very loudly] Play me a C-sharp and I'll tell you it's a C even though I know better—that's not anxiety, that's neural damage from acoustic trauma!

Character 1: [firmly] The company's liability insurance requires proof of negligence or equipment failure. [sighs] Without that, even if your condition is real, the claim would fall under regular medical leave, not workers compensation.

Character 2: [desperately] Regular medical leave pays nothing compared to what I've lost! [quieter] Twenty years building a reputation as the best keyboard tech in the state, and now I can't even trust my own ears.

Character 1: [empathetically] I'm going to recommend a specialized audiological evaluation with Dr. Martinez who studies perfect pitch disorders. [warm] If she confirms neurological changes from the incident, it could support your claim.

Character 2: [relieved] You believe me? [hopeful] Most people think perfect pitch is some kind of party trick, not a professional tool that took decades to refine and can be destroyed in an instant.

Character 1: I believe something happened to you that day. [quietly] Whether it meets the legal threshold for workers compensation is what we need to determine through proper documentation and medical expertise.

Character 2: [exhausted] Fair enough. [sighs] Just know that every piano I walk past now sounds like a beautiful lie, perfectly tuned to everyone else while my brain insists it's wrong. [very quietly] That's my new reality.
