Scenario: asking why their gift card balance shows zero

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I just—I just tried to use my gift card and it says zero. That's not right.

Customer Support: Oh no, that's definitely not right. Let me pull up your account here, um... can you give me the gift card number? It should start with GC and then have about sixteen digits after that.

Customer: It's it's right here. GC-4782-9901-2234-5567.

Customer Support: Got it, okay so I'm seeing—hmm, that's strange. The card shows it was loaded with $150 on December 3rd, but then... er, let me check the transaction history real quick here.

Customer: I've been a customer for twelve years. Twelve. And now my card just...

Customer Support: No no, we're absolutely going to fix this. I see what happened—there was a, uh... what's the word... a system glitch on December 5th that affected batch number BTH-92847. Your card got caught in that mess.

Customer: So what, my money's just gone? This was a birthday gift and I...

Customer Support: Not gone at all! I'm already—actually wait, let me just—okay, I'm crediting your account right now with the full $150 plus, hmm, an extra $25 for the trouble. Reference number is REF-7829-XK41.

Customer: Oh. Okay okay okay. So I can use it now?

Customer Support: Well, here's what I'm gonna do—and between you and me, this usually takes twenty-four hours but, er... I'm pushing it through as priority. Transaction ID TXN-4902-LP. Should be active in about five minutes.

Customer: That's—that's actually great. But what if this happens again?

Customer Support: So I've added a note to your account—note number NTE-88293—that flags you for our premium support tier. Basically if anything weird happens again, you skip the queue and get someone who can... let's say, bend the rules a bit.

Customer: Huh. I didn't know that was a thing.

Customer Support: It's not, technically. But after twelve years? Your loyalty score is LS-9847, which is, oof, really high. So I'm making it a thing for you. Just reference case number CSE-4401-MK next time you call.

Customer: Well. Thank you. I mean that. Next time though I might not be so...

Customer Support: Totally understand. And honestly? You shouldn't have to deal with this. I'm also, uhh... what I'll do is add a backup code BGK-7729 to your profile that gives you fifteen percent off your next purchase. Just as a... you know.

Customer: Fifteen percent? That's generous. Alright, so five minutes then?

Customer Support: Yep, five minutes max. Your new balance will show as $175 under transaction TRX-9902-AA. And, er, if for some reason it doesn't update—which it will—but if it doesn't...

Customer: I'll reference that case number. Got it got it.

Customer Support: Perfect. Oh and hey—check your email in about an hour. There might be a, hmm... let's call it a loyalty surprise. Code preview: it starts with VIP-8827. But you didn't hear that from me.
