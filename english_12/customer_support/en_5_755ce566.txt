=== Dialogue ===

Customer: My account balance shows two different amounts. I need clarification on what's actually available to spend today.

Customer Support: I understand your concern. Let me access your account and explain the difference between your available balance and posted balance. May I have your account number?

Customer: It's 445-890-2341. There's a three hundred dollar difference between the two balances shown.

Customer Support: Thank you. I can see your posted balance is $2,847.50 and your available balance is $2,547.50, which reflects a $300 pending transaction from Hartley Electronics.

Customer: What exactly does pending mean? The purchase was three days ago but it's still not finalized.

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: So when will that transaction actually post to my account?

Customer Support: Pending transactions are temporary holds that merchants place on your funds. Most retail transactions like your TRX-884290 from Hartley Electronics typically post within 2-5 business days.

Customer: Does the pending amount count against my daily spending limit or overdraft protection?

Customer Support: Yes, pending transactions immediately reduce your available balance to prevent overspending. Your daily limit of $5,000 factors in both posted and pending amounts for real-time accuracy.

Customer: I see another pending charge for seventy-five dollars that I don't recognize.

Customer Support: I can see that pending authorization PA-7829-441 for $75.00 from Digital Streaming Services. This appears to be an annual subscription renewal that initiated yesterday at 3:47 PM.

Customer: Can pending transactions be cancelled or do I have to wait for them to post first?

Customer Support: Of course.

Customer: What happens if a pending transaction never posts? I had one disappear last month.

Customer Support: Pending authorizations automatically expire after their hold period, typically 3-7 business days depending on the merchant category. When authorization AU-9982-KL expired last month, those funds became immediately available again.

Customer: Should I track my spending based on the posted or available balance?

Customer Support: Always use your available balance for spending decisions. This reflects your true purchasing power after accounting for all pending transactions, ensuring you won't overdraft your account.

Customer: That makes sense. Can you send me documentation about how these transactions process?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'll email our transaction processing guide to your registered address within the next hour. Is there anything else regarding your account reference ACC-445890-2341 that I can clarify today?
