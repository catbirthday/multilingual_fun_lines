=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I was told my complaint would be escalated to management—so basically that never happened?

Customer Support: Oh, let me—hmm, let me pull up your case history real quick. Can you give me your reference number from the previous call?

Customer: It's, I think—no wait, let me find it—REF something, hold on.

Customer Support: No worries, take your time. Actually if you have your account email I can search that way too, might be faster.

Customer: Look, I spent forty minutes on the phone yesterday—do you know how frustrating this is?

Customer Support: I completely understand, that's—oof, that's a long time. Okay so I found your case, it's CASE-891204-TK, and er, you're right, there's no escalation note here which is definitely not what should've happened.

Customer: This is basically the third time I've called about the same issue.

Customer Support: Right right, I see all three calls here. Um, what I'm gonna do—actually let me just create an escalation ticket right now, ESC-7782-MNP, and I'll personally mark it priority status.

Customer: So like, how do I know this one will actually go through?

Customer Support: Great question. So I'm giving you a direct tracking code, TRK-445-88QV, and here's what's different—I'm attaching all three previous calls plus, uh, hang on... yeah, I'm adding a supervisor flag that means it has to be reviewed within 24 hours.

Customer: I mean, I sort of need this resolved before the weekend—is that even possible?

Customer Support: Mmm, let me check the escalation queue... okay so good news, your assigned manager is MGR-DAVIES-07 and she's actually online right now. Should I try to, er, warm transfer you directly?

Customer: Wait, you can—that would actually be amazing if you could do that.

Customer Support: Absolutely. Though just so you know, if she's with another customer it might take, um, maybe five minutes? But I'll stay on while we wait, make sure you get connected properly this time.

Customer: Oh. Okay so I guess—yeah, I can wait if she's really available.

Customer Support: Perfect. While I'm setting this up—actually your account shows you're, hmm, platinum tier? That should've triggered automatic escalation. Let me add note PRI-PLAT-9902 to make sure this doesn't happen again.

Customer: That's what I thought! Like, I pay for premium support, right?

Customer Support: Exactly, yeah, you shouldn't have to chase us down. Oh! Good timing—Manager Davies just freed up. Transferring now with reference ESC-7782-MNP-PRIORITY. She'll have your full history.

Customer: Thank God. So she'll actually have all the information?

Customer Support: Yep, everything's attached—all three calls, your platinum status flag PLT-8827, the original issue details, plus my notes about the failed escalation. You're all set, connecting you now.
