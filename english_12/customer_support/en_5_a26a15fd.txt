=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So like I called yesterday and um basically got hung up on so I guess I'm trying again

Customer Support: Okay, let me pull up your account history here... hmm, I see the disconnected call at 3:47 PM. I'm looking at case number CSE-2847-MJ and it shows, er, technical difficulties on our end.

Customer: Yeah so the guy was like really rude and then just click nothing so

Customer Support: Right, that's not acceptable at all. What I can do—let me see—I'm flagging this for review under complaint ID CMP-9021-X. Um, was this regarding your order or account issue?

Customer: Order thing um the laptop that's like basically been lost for two weeks

Customer Support: Got it, okay so... huh, I'm seeing order ORD-7741-BK22 here. Shows shipped but, er, no tracking updates since December 12th. That's definitely stuck somewhere.

Customer: Right so like yesterday I just wanted answers and the guy was basically—I don't know forget it

Customer Support: No no, let's fix this. I'm filing report RPT-3029 for the service issue, and, um, for your actual order—let me check with shipping real quick here.

Customer: Look I'm sorry I'm just frustrated and like tired of calling about this you know

Customer Support: Hey, totally get it. So shipping shows, erm, package got misrouted to warehouse ZIP 47802. What I'm doing now—submitting reroute request RRQ-5512-AA to get it back on track.

Customer: Oh um okay so it's actually findable? Not just gone?

Customer Support: Yeah absolutely findable. Hmm, let me explain what happened—so packages with label prefix LBL-7741 got batch-scanned wrong. Fixable though, er, usually takes 48 hours once I submit this.

Customer: Sorry I'm being like short with you you're actually helping unlike yesterday

Customer Support: No worries at all, honestly. So I've put priority flag PRI-8823 on this. Um, also adding credit code CRD-DELAY50 to your account—that's fifty dollars for the hassle.

Customer: Wait really? I mean I didn't even ask for—that's um that's really nice actually

Customer Support: Standard for delays over ten days. Let me also, uh—yep, waiving express shipping fee FSH-2901. Should see your laptop by Friday, tracking will update tonight.

Customer: Okay so like Friday for sure? Not another maybe date that doesn't happen?

Customer Support: Looking at the reroute path... hmm, through hub HUB-47A to your local facility at 2819 Oak Street. Er, barring weather, yes, Friday by 6 PM guaranteed.

Customer: I'm sorry for being difficult earlier I just—yesterday really sucked you know

Customer Support: Seriously, don't apologize. I've noted everything in case CSE-2847-MJ about yesterday's call. Oh also—sending confirmation email now with reference number REF-1129-QP for all today's updates.
