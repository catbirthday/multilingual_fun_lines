Scenario: asking why their promotional discount code isn't working

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm trying to use promotional code SAVE25 at checkout, but it's showing as invalid. This was sent to me yesterday.

Customer Support: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Let me access your account and check the status of that promotional code. May I have your email address associated with the account?

Customer: It's michael.chen@stratosdigital.com. The email clearly states the code is valid through Sunday.

Customer Support: Perfect, I have your account pulled up. I can see you received our promotional email yesterday at 3:47 PM with code SAVE25 for our premium subscription upgrade. Let me verify why it's not applying correctly.

Customer: I need this resolved quickly. I'm presenting the upgraded features to my team this afternoon.

Customer Support: I understand the urgency. I've identified the issue - the code is specifically linked to annual billing plans, and you're currently attempting to apply it to a monthly subscription option.

Customer: The email doesn't mention that restriction anywhere. Can you point me to where that's stated?

Customer Support: You're absolutely right to question that. I'm reviewing the email template sent from our marketing system, reference ID MKT-8924-Q3, and I can confirm the billing restriction wasn't clearly communicated in yesterday's campaign.

Customer: So how do we resolve this? I need the discount you promised.

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: And I'm not interested in being locked into an annual plan when the terms weren't disclosed properly.

Customer Support: That's completely reasonable and I apologize for the confusion. I'm going to create a custom discount code that will apply to your monthly plan, matching the 25% savings you were expecting.

Customer: That works. When will I receive the new code?

Customer Support: I'm generating it right now. Your new promotional code is MCHEN-7251-SP and it's already active in our system. This code will provide 25% off your monthly premium subscription for the next six months.

Customer: Six months of the discount? That's better than the original offer.

Customer Support: Correct. Given the inconvenience and the miscommunication in our marketing email, I've extended the discount period as a courtesy. The code will automatically apply the savings through April 2024.

Customer: Perfect. I just applied it and it's working. Can you email me confirmation of these terms?

Customer Support: Absolutely. I'm sending a detailed confirmation to michael.chen@stratosdigital.com right now. You'll receive it within the next five minutes with reference number SUP-4082-MC for your records.

Customer: Excellent service. Thank you for resolving this professionally and quickly.

Customer Support: You're very welcome. I've also added a note to your account about this interaction and forwarded feedback to our marketing team about the unclear promotional terms. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
