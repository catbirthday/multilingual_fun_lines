=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I've been noticing you around here a lot lately.

Character 2: Yeah, I started coming here about three weeks ago. The coffee's decent and the wifi actually works, unlike at my apartment. Plus it's quiet enough to actually focus.

Character 1: [stuttering] I-I work on that corner across the street, the glass building.

Character 2: Oh, the Meridian Tower? That's a nice building. I interviewed there once for a marketing position but ended up taking something else.

Character 1: Marketing sounds interesting. Is that what you do now?

Character 2: No, I switched to data analysis about two years ago. Marketing was fun but I wanted something more concrete, you know? Numbers don't lie the way focus groups do.

Character 1: Numbers can be pretty straightforward I guess.

Character 2: Exactly. Give me a spreadsheet over a brainstorming session any day. Though I do miss the creative campaigns sometimes—there's something satisfying about seeing your idea on a billboard.

Character 1: You come here same time every day pretty much.

Character 2: Tuesdays and Thursdays, usually around two. My schedule's flexible so I work better in the afternoon when my brain actually decides to cooperate. Morning person I am definitely not.

Character 1: [regretful] I should probably introduce myself at this point.

Character 2: [monotone] That would be the normal thing to do after stalking my coffee schedule. I'm Jordan. And you're the person who always orders the same vanilla latte with an extra shot.

Character 1: [shouting] You noticed that too?

Character 2: [slowly] Hard not to when you order it loud enough for the entire cafe to hear. The barista doesn't even ask anymore, just starts making it when you walk in. Pretty efficient system you've got there.

Character 1: I like consistency in my coffee orders.

Character 2: [frustrated] Look, are you trying to ask me something here? Because we've been dancing around whatever this is for five minutes and my laptop battery is dying.

Character 1: Would you maybe want to grab that coffee together sometime?

Character 2: [sniffle] Oh. That's what this was about. You could have just led with that instead of the whole mysterious observer routine.

Character 1: So is that a yes or should I keep being mysterious?

Character 2: Sure, why not. But next time just ask directly—saves us both the awkward small talk about buildings and spreadsheets. How about tomorrow, same time, same terrible vanilla latte?
