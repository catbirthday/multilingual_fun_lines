Character 1: So I wanted to talk to you about the salary we discussed for this position.

Character 2: [very quickly] Oh right, yeah, um, the salary thing. I mean, we're still kind of working through all the details on that actually, there's a lot of moving parts with the budget and everything.

Character 1: [extremely happy] But you said forty-five thousand was definitely doable last week!

Character 2: [smiling speaking] Well, I mean, that was more of a, you know, ballpark figure we were throwing around. Things have gotten a bit more complicated since then with, uh, some organizational changes happening.

Character 1: What kind of organizational changes? This is the third time you've mentioned something vague.

Character 2: It's just—look, there's been some restructuring in, um, how we allocate resources across departments. I don't have all the details myself yet, which is frustrating, I know, but that's kind of where we're at.

Character 1: Can you at least tell me if we're still in the same range?

Character 2: Honestly? I wish I could give you a straight answer but, erm, everything's kind of up in the air right now. Maybe we could revisit this in a couple weeks when things settle down?

Character 1: [laugh hysterically] A couple weeks? I already gave notice at my current job!

Character 2: Oh. Oh no, that's—I didn't realize you'd already... Look, maybe I can, uh, talk to someone higher up and see if we can expedite things a bit.

Character 1: Who exactly makes these decisions? Because you seemed pretty confident before.

Character 2: Yeah, I mean, technically it goes through several layers of approval, and, well, sometimes what seems straightforward initially gets more complex when legal and HR get involved, you know?

Character 1: [long pause] Are you trying to lowball me?

Character 2: No, no, it's not like that at all. I just—there's been some, mmm, unexpected pushback from finance about new hire compensation packages across the board, not just yours.

Character 1: [mocking] Unexpected pushback. Right. So what number are they actually comfortable with?

Character 2: I don't... I don't actually have a firm number yet, which I realize sounds, uh, incredibly unprofessional. They're reviewing comparable positions in the market or something like that.

Character 1: [happy] Well good news, I already did that research. Want to see my spreadsheet?

Character 2: Oh, um, sure, but I should probably mention that they tend to have their own, err, methodology for these things. External research doesn't always align with how they view internal equity and all that.

Character 1: So basically you're saying my research won't matter to them?

Character 2: [enunciating every word] I'm saying that the process is more complicated than I initially led you to believe, and for that I genuinely apologize, because this isn't how this should have gone.
