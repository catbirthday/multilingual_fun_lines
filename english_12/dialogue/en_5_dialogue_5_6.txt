=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So I've been thinking about candy lately and, uh, how weird it is that we basically eat colored sugar for fun.

Character 2: [high-pitched] Oh my god, yes! I mean, when you put it like that it sounds absolutely ridiculous, but here we are, grown adults getting genuinely excited about, like, gummy bears and stuff.

Character 1: Right? And we have such strong opinions about it too.

Character 2: Mmm, totally. Like, I will literally fight someone who says Twizzlers are better than Red Vines—that's just, no, that's objectively wrong and I don't care what anyone says about it.

Character 1: Wait wait wait, you're a Red Vines person? Seriously?

Character 2: Oh absolutely, one hundred percent. Twizzlers taste like, I dunno, waxy disappointment? Red Vines have that actually fruity thing going on, they're softer, and—okay this sounds weird—but they make better straws for movie theater sodas.

Character 1: That's... huh. I've never tried the straw thing.

Character 2: You haven't lived! Though, uh, fair warning, it gets pretty messy if you leave them in too long because they sort of, um, dissolve? But for the first few sips it's basically perfection.

Character 1: What about chocolate though? That's gotta be the superior candy category.

Character 2: Ooh, see now we're talking. Dark chocolate specifically—like 70% cacao minimum—that's the real deal, none of this milk chocolate nonsense that's basically just sugar pretending to be sophisticated.

Character 1: Wow, you're really passionate about this stuff, aren't you?

Character 2: Honestly? Yeah, I kind of am. Food is one of those universal pleasures, you know? And candy is like, the most purely indulgent version of that—zero nutritional value, just straight-up joy chemicals for your brain.

Character 1: [very sad] I haven't had good chocolate in months. Been trying to cut back on sugar.

Character 2: Oof, that's rough. I tried that once and lasted maybe, errm, three days? The thing is though, completely cutting it out sometimes makes the cravings worse—like, a square of really good dark chocolate might actually be better than white-knuckling it.

Character 1: Yeah but one square turns into the whole bar, you know how it goes.

Character 2: Man, I feel that. The struggle is so real. Have you tried those, um, fancy single-origin bars where they're so expensive you physically can't justify eating the whole thing at once? Economic portion control, basically.

Character 1: That's... actually kind of brilliant. Weaponizing my cheapness against my sugar addiction.

Character 2: Right? Works for me anyway. Plus when you're paying twelve bucks for a chocolate bar, you really, really savor it instead of just, like, mindlessly demolishing it while watching Netflix.

Character 1: Speaking of which, what's your absolute favorite candy of all time?

Character 2: Gosh, that's tough. But if I'm being completely honest? Those Japanese Kit Kats, the matcha ones specifically—they're sweet but not too sweet, and there's something about that green tea flavor that just, mmm, hits different than regular candy.
