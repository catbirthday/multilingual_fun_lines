=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [joking] Please tell me you're not the one who signed up for the extreme rapids with zero experience.

Character 2: [empathetically] That would be me, actually. I know it sounds insane but my therapist said I needed to stop living in my head and start feeling things in my body—apparently near-death experiences count.

Character 1: Your therapist told you to go white water rafting?

Character 2: She said to "embrace physical challenges that force presence." I figured class four rapids would definitely force me to be present, assuming I don't get swept downstream first.

Character 1: [warm] Well, you picked the right guide. I've run this river maybe three hundred times.

Character 2: Three hundred times on the same river? Don't you get bored seeing the same rocks and turns over and over again?

Character 1: It's never the same river twice. Water levels change everything.

Character 2: That's either deeply philosophical or you're trying to make me feel better about my impending doom. Either way, I appreciate the effort—my ex-husband would've just laughed at me.

Character 1: [child-like] Wait, is that why you're here? Post-divorce adventure phase?

Character 2: Post-divorce, post-career-change, post-everything phase. Sold my dental practice, bought an RV, and decided to do everything that terrified me for a year.

Character 1: You were a dentist?

Character 2: Orthodontist for fifteen years. Spent my days staring into teenagers' mouths and pretending their parents weren't insane—turns out I was the insane one for choosing that life.

Character 1: What else is on your terror list?

Character 2: Skydiving, done. Standup comedy, bombed spectacularly. Snake handling, which was weirdly therapeutic, and next month I'm doing an ayahuasca ceremony in Peru.

Character 1: [long pause] You went from braces to ayahuasca. That's... quite a journey.

Character 2: Life's too short to keep playing it safe. I spent forty-three years being responsible and all it got me was a nice house I never enjoyed and a husband who preferred his secretary.

Character 1: [very quickly] Oh god, I'm sorry, that's awful.

Character 2: Don't be sorry—she did me a favor. If Jennifer from accounting hadn't sent those photos to the wrong phone, I'd still be living my beige little life in suburban Connecticut.

Character 1: And instead you're about to hit class four rapids with a complete stranger.

Character 2: A complete stranger who's done this three hundred times. Besides, the best things in my life have happened when I trusted strangers—that's how I learned I could survive anything.
