            "content": "[confidently] Oh, citation analysis is basically this whole field that studies how academic papers reference each other—you know, who's citing whom, which papers are influential. Eugene Garfield pretty much invented the whole thing back in the 1950s when he founded the Institute for Scientific Information."

            "content": "Mmm, that's... that's actually a contentious issue. Google Scholar definitely inflates citation counts because it includes, like, preprints and dissertations and all sorts of grey literature, but Anne-Wil Harzing's Publish or Perish software uses it pretty effectively, so, I mean, it depends what you're trying to measure really."

            "content": "That's actually really impressive! I mean, according to data from ResearchGate and ORCID profiles, an h-index above 40 usually puts someone in, like, the top tier of their field, though it varies wildly between disciplines—physicists tend to have way higher numbers than historians, for instance."

            "content": "[sarcastic] Oh, well, clearly it's because physics is just so much more important than every other field. No but seriously, it's actually about, um, publication culture—physics papers often have dozens of authors from CERN or Fermilab collaborations, and they cite each other constantly, whereas humanities scholars tend to work solo."

Some researchers form citation cartels, there's self-citation padding, and certain journals like Scientific Reports have been accused of, well, basically gaming the system to boost their Journal Impact Factor scores."

The thing is, Goodhart's Law really applies here—once a metric becomes a target, it kind of ceases to be a good metric, and universities like Harvard and MIT are actually starting to move away from pure citation counts for tenure decisions."

Plus tools like Dimensions or Semantic Scholar can show you who's building on your work, which is, I mean, genuinely exciting when it starts happening—even if it's just one or two citations at first."
