=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: So you're actually doing that whole life cycle assessment thing for your job now.

Character 2: Oh yeah, I mean, it's been like three months now and honestly it's way more intense than I expected. We're basically tracking every single material from, uh, cradle to grave, you know?

Character 1: Sounds tedious.

Character 2: Well, okay, it can be, but there's something kind of fascinating about realizing that like, a simple coffee cup has this whole hidden story of, mmm, transportation emissions and water usage and everything.

Character 1: I guess everything has impact.

Character 2: [deep pitch] Exactly, and that's what gets me—we did this assessment on smartphone production last week and, geez, the rare earth mining alone is just... it's overwhelming when you see the actual numbers laid out.

Character 1: [hesitantly] Are you... are you trying to make me feel guilty about my phone?

Character 2: No no, sorry, I'm not trying to be preachy or anything. It's more like, once you start seeing these patterns everywhere, it's hard to, uh, turn it off, if that makes sense?

Character 1: Must be exhausting knowing all that.

Character 2: Yeah, sometimes.

Character 1: [stern] You used to be more fun before this job.

Character 2: [loudly] Oh come on, I'm still fun! I just happen to know that your t-shirt probably traveled fifteen thousand miles and used about seven hundred gallons of water, but hey, I can still party!

Character 1: There you go again.

Character 2: [jealous] At least I'm doing something meaningful, unlike your consulting gig where you just, I mean, move numbers around spreadsheets all day for companies that probably don't even care about their impact.

Character 1: That was unnecessary.

Character 2: Ahh, you're right, I'm sorry, that was... that was out of line. I guess I'm just, err, feeling defensive because everyone keeps telling me I've become this environmental buzzkill lately.

Character 1: Maybe take a break from analyzing everything.

Character 2: Ha, easier said than done when it's literally my job, but yeah, you're probably right. Remember when we used to just, like, buy stuff without thinking about supply chains and carbon footprints?

Character 1: [yawn] Those were simpler times.

Character 2: Mmm, simpler for sure. Hey, want to grab dinner somewhere? I promise I won't mention the restaurant's food waste statistics or, um, their sourcing practices... okay, I'll try not to anyway.
