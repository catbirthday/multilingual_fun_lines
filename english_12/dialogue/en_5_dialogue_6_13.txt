=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Hi, I graduated in 2015 and someone said I should reach out to alumni relations?

Character 2: Oh wow, class of 2015! That was such an incredible year—honestly one of our most accomplished graduating classes. What have you been up to since then, because I'm sure it's something amazing knowing that cohort.

Character 1: [stern] I'm actually between jobs right now. That's why I'm calling.

Character 2: Hey, no no no, that's—that's totally normal, and actually, um, you reaching out right now? That's really smart. Like, seriously, most people wait way too long to tap into their alumni network when they're in transition.

Character 1: Really? I felt weird about it.

Character 2: Are you kidding? This is literally what we're here for, and honestly, some of our most successful alumni went through exactly what you're experiencing right now. I mean, career pivots are where the magic happens, you know?

Character 1: What kind of help can you actually provide though?

Character 2: [speeding up] Oh man, so much—we've got this whole career services portal, one-on-one coaching sessions, and wait wait wait, the best part? Our alumni mentor program where we match you with someone in your field who's just, like, incredibly generous with their time.

Character 1: How does the mentor matching work?

Character 2: [yawn] Sorry, long day—but this is the exciting part! We look at your background, your goals, and then, um, we hand-pick three potential mentors who've literally walked your exact path. Like, it's kind of uncanny how well we nail these matches.

Character 1: [warm] That actually sounds pretty helpful. What's the time commitment?

Character 2: Super flexible, and that's what I love about our alums—they really get it, you know? Most do monthly check-ins, maybe coffee once a quarter, but honestly, they're so invested in your success that they often go way beyond that.

Character 1: [empathetically] I appreciate you not making me feel bad about needing help.

Character 2: Oh gosh, are you—no, you should feel proud for reaching out! Seriously, the most successful people I know are the ones who, uh, aren't afraid to lean on their community when they need to.

Character 1: What field did you say the mentors come from?

Character 2: Well, we've got alumni in literally everything—tech, finance, nonprofits, arts—but here's what's cool: we match based on where you want to go, not just where you've been. It's all about your future, which I think is just brilliant.

Character 1: [whispering loudly] My roommate's sleeping but I wanted to ask about networking events too?

Character 2: Ooh yes, we do monthly mixers, and they're actually really fun—not those awkward corporate things at all. People genuinely want to help each other, and I mean, the connections made there? Life-changing stuff, truly.

Character 1: This is way more support than I expected honestly.

Character 2: That's what I hear all the time, and it just—it makes me so happy because, like, you earned this by being part of our community. This network is yours forever, and we're genuinely thrilled when you use it, really.
