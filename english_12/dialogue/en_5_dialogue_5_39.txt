=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Have you seen these new AI tutors they're rolling out in schools?

Character 2: Oh yeah, I've been, umm, following that whole thing actually. But you know what's weird? Nobody seems to be asking the kids what they actually think about having an AI explain algebra to them—like, are they finding it helpful or just kind of creepy?

Character 1: [chuckle] My nephew says his AI tutor sounds like a robot trying to be cool.

Character 2: Ha! That's... that's actually really telling, isn't it? I mean, we're spending billions on this tech but if kids think it's cringe, then what's even the point? Do you think maybe we're solving the wrong problem here?

Character 1: What do you mean?

Character 2: Well, it's just—okay so, everyone keeps saying teachers are overwhelmed, right? But then instead of, I dunno, hiring more teachers or paying them better, we're basically trying to replace them with chatbots that can't even tell when a kid is having a bad day.

Character 1: [warm] That's a really good point. The human element matters.

Character 2: Exactly! And, ahh, here's what really gets me—have you noticed how all these edtech companies are run by people who haven't been in a classroom since they graduated? Like, what makes them think they understand what actually works for learning?

Character 1: They probably just see dollar signs.

Character 2: Oh absolutely, the market's supposedly worth, errr, something like three hundred billion now? But honestly, when you look at actual test scores and engagement, are kids really learning better with all these tablets and apps, or are we just, you know, making Silicon Valley richer?

Character 1: My daughter's school just bought VR headsets for history class.

Character 2: VR for history—jeez, that sounds either amazing or completely overwhelming. Can you imagine trying to process the French Revolution while you're virtually standing in it? Also, um, what happens to the kids who get motion sick?

Character 1: She threw up the first day.

Character 2: Oof, yeah, that's... that's exactly what I'm talking about. We get so caught up in the wow factor that nobody stops to ask the practical questions, like, hmm, maybe twelve-year-olds shouldn't be doing immersive Napoleonic battles before lunch?

Character 1: The teacher didn't know how to work it either.

Character 2: Right? And that's the other thing—we dump all this technology on teachers who are already stretched thin and then what, expect them to become IT specialists overnight? I actually read that the average teacher spends, uhh, something like two hours a week just troubleshooting tech problems now.

Character 1: What do you think would actually help?

Character 2: [high-pitched] Honestly? I think we need to slow way down and actually, like, listen to what teachers and students need instead of just throwing the latest shiny thing at them. Remember when everyone thought smartboards would revolutionize education, and now half of them are just really expensive whiteboards?

Character 1: Those things never worked right.

Character 2: Exactly! And yet here we are again with AI and VR and, err, whatever comes next, probably holograms or something. But you know what still works? A good teacher who actually cares, a quiet place to study, and maybe—crazy idea—books that don't need software updates every three months.
