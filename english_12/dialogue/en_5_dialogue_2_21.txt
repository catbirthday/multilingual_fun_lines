=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Wait, you're our escape room host? I thought you worked in returns.

Character 2: Oh yeah, I do both actually. Returns during the week, escape rooms on weekends—it's, um, weirdly similar honestly. People panicking about deadlines, looking for missing pieces... Anyway, ready? First sequence is seven, four, nine.

Character 1: [over confidently] Seven four nine, got it. That's the lock on the desk, right?

Character 2: Mmm, no actually that's for the briefcase under the painting. See, everyone thinks it's the desk but, uh, that's kind of the trick—the obvious lock is never the right one first.

Character 1: [loudly] THERE'S NO BRIEFCASE HERE!

Character 2: [joking] Oh gosh, did you check behind the fake plant? It's literally always behind the fake plant. I mean, I've been running this room for six months and somehow people never—yeah, there you go.

Character 1: Okay it's open. What's next?

Character 2: [chuckle] Nice! Alright so inside there should be, um, three colored keys. The sequence for those—and this is important—blue goes to station two, red is actually station five, not three like everyone assumes.

Character 1: Station numbers? Where are those?

Character 2: [overly polite] Oh I'm so terribly sorry, I should have mentioned—if you look at the baseboards, there are these tiny little numbers painted in gold. They're, well, they're admittedly hard to spot but once you see one you'll notice them everywhere.

Character 1: Found them! Blue in two... okay, what numbers do I need?

Character 2: Right, so this part gets a bit tricky. You're looking for eight, eight, two, one—but wait, that's only after you've flipped the switch behind the mirror, which, uh, most people forget about entirely.

Character 1: There's a switch behind the mirror?

Character 2: Erhm, yeah, the mirror actually slides left about, I'd say, three inches? Just enough to reach behind. Honestly, working returns has made me really good at finding hidden damage on products, so designing these puzzles is basically the same skill.

Character 1: Got the switch. Now eight eight two one?

Character 2: [happy] Perfect! Oh you're actually doing better than the last group—they spent twenty minutes arguing about whether the mirror was even movable. Next sequence coming up: five, zero, three, seven, and then immediately nine, nine.

Character 1: Whoa slow down, five zero...?

Character 2: [very quickly] Five zero three seven nine nine—sorry sorry, I get excited when groups are doing well. Um, that opens the panel near the window, which has the UV flashlight you'll need for the next part.

Character 1: This is way harder than Amazon returns.

Character 2: [stern] Listen, returns are actually more complicated—at least here the numbers stay the same. In returns, every barcode changes, every policy updates weekly, and, well, nobody yells at you in an escape room for being confused.
