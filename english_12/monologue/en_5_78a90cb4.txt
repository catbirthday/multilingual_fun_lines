Subject: Your maintenance crew reporting that the building's foundation is critically damaged

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] Okay, so we've got a... we've got a real problem here. I mean, I've been doing this for fifteen years and I've never—this is bad. Really bad. [clearing throat] So the crew just finished the inspection, right? And the foundation is, uh... it's critically compromised. We're talking major structural cracks, not just surface stuff. [stern] These are load-bearing failures running through the entire northeast corner. 

The thing is, we found water damage that's been, hmm, accumulating for probably years? [frustrated] And nobody caught it because it was behind that false wall in the basement. The concrete's literally crumbling when you touch it. [pause] I don't know how else to say this but... we need to evacuate. Like, now. 

[speaking fast] The engineer's saying the whole thing could shift, especially with all the rain we're expecting this week. We're looking at potential collapse if we don't—I mean, this isn't something we can patch up. [very loudly] Everyone needs to get out! This is, uh... this is way beyond repair work. [shaky voice] I've already called the city inspector but honestly? I don't think this building's salvageable. Twenty-seven families live here. [sigh] God, how do I even tell them?
