=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [exhausted] God, I finally—I finally got it. Three weeks of staring at this stupid interface and it just clicked. [relieved] All those dropdown menus and subsections and eligibility codes, they actually make sense now. [pause] Wait, hold on. If I'm reading this right... [confused] these families, they all qualify? [speeding up] The Johnsons with the twins, Mrs. Chen who's been putting off her surgery, that couple with the premie baby— [gasp softly] Oh my God. They don't even know. [very excited] They've been paying out of pocket or just going without, and this whole time there was coverage sitting there! [passionate] I can fix this. I can actually fix this for them. [laugh] All those hours wanting to throw my computer out the window, and now I'm looking at, what, forty-something families? [warm] Real people who are gonna get their medications, their treatments, their kids' checkups. [pause] This is why I took this job. Not for the, um... not for the data entry or the filing. [very sincerely] For this exact moment. When you realize you're about to change someone's life with a few clicks. [happy] Tomorrow morning, I'm calling every single one of them.
