=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] What? I—wait, are you serious? [pause] Patient care? My anxiety is affecting... [trailing off] [upset] Oh God. Um, I didn't realize it was that obvious. [shaky voice] I mean, I've been trying so hard to keep it together, you know? [defensive] Every single shift, I show up and I do my job. [sigh] Okay, maybe my hands shake sometimes when I'm suturing, but I've never—I would never put anyone at risk. [hurt] You really think I'm that bad? [long pause] [quietly] Jesus, maybe I am. I keep thinking I have it under control and then, um... then something like a code comes in and my chest gets so tight I can barely breathe. [regretful] But I always push through it. Always. [angry] And now you're telling me that's not enough? That you can't even—[voice breaking] that you won't work with me? [sniffle] How long have you been thinking this? Watching me fall apart and just... what, taking notes? [bitter] Great. That's just great. [exhausted] I became a doctor to help people, and now I'm the one who needs help. [very sad] Maybe you're right. Maybe I shouldn't be here at all. [whispering] God, what am I even doing anymore?
