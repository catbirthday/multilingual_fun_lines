Twenty of us against their whole camp, and Jimmy—Uncle Jimmy to you—he just walks right up to their gate with nothing but a crowbar and this crazy grin. [animated] And the guard's like \"Who goes there?\" and Jimmy goes \"Your worst nightmare!\" [chuckle] Classic Jimmy. We took everything they had that night, every last— [pause] \n\nWait, why are you two smiling like that? [concerned] This isn't— these aren't supposed to be the good guys in the story, you understand that, right? We were... we were the bad guys. [regretful] Your old man did some things that, um, that weren't exactly heroic. \n\n[quietly] I mean, sure, we had our code. Never hurt kids, always left them enough food to survive the week. But we still— we took what wasn't ours. [hesitant] Those people were scared of us. Really scared. \n\n[worried] And now you're sitting here looking at me like I'm some kind of— like these are adventure stories or something. They're not. They're, uh... they're cautionary tales, okay? [stern] About what not to become. About choices that follow you forever. \n\n[sad] Sometimes I wonder if I should even tell you these things at all."
