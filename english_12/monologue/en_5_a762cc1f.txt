[whispering] The brushwork, the way the light hits the— [speeding up] oh my god, that's a real Caravaggio signature, isn't it? [anxious] Nobody else has noticed. Keep it together, just breathe. [slowly] The estate owner's grandson is watching me from the kitchen. [nervous laugh] Act casual, look at other things first. [mumbling] These ceramic cats are, um... interesting. Very collectible.
