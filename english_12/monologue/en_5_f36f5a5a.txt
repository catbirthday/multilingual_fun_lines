Subject: The benefits administrator training you provided helped your replacement exceed all expectations

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I just heard from Sandra about how Marcus is doing. [extremely happy] Oh my god, he's absolutely crushing it! [laugh] When I was training him on all the benefits systems, he kept asking these super detailed questions. [animated] Like, questions I'd never even thought about after five years doing that job! He wanted to know every single edge case, every weird scenario. [proudly] And now apparently he's streamlined the entire open enrollment process. Cut processing time by forty percent! [gasp softly] Forty percent! I mean, I thought I had a pretty good system going, but... [trailing off] wow. [warm] HR sent me this email saying he's the best benefits admin they've ever had. [pause] Which is, um... that's including me, obviously. [chuckle] But honestly? [very sincerely] I'm not even mad about it. I'm actually kind of proud? [excited] Like, I trained him! Those spreadsheet templates he's using, the vendor relationships, the way he handles escalations— [speeding up] that's all stuff we worked on together during those two weeks! [sigh] It's weird though. Part of me wonders if I was, uh, if I was holding myself back somehow. [confused] Like, was all that potential there for me too? [long pause] But you know what? [relieved] It doesn't matter. He's thriving, employees are happy, and I got to be part of that. [cheerful] That's pretty cool actually.
