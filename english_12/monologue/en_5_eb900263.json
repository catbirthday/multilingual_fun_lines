[pause] Nobody in the corporate world would touch me. [frustrated] Resume after resume, and they'd Google my name and— that was it. Done. [sigh] But then I started volunteering at the youth center just to, um, just to fill the time, honestly. [curious] And these kids, they looked at me different. [warm] Not like damaged goods. They saw someone who actually knew what they were talking about. [passionately] \"You really been locked up?\" they'd ask. And suddenly I wasn't lying to them about consequences. [chuckle] I wasn't some counselor reading from a textbook. [very sincerely] I was proof that you could mess up— really mess up— and still find your way. [emotional] This one kid, Marcus, he said I was the first adult who didn't talk down to him. [pause] Said I got it. [quietly] And I did. I really did. [relieved] So yeah, that reputation that cost me six-figure jobs? [smiling speaking] It's what makes these kids actually listen when I tell them there's another way. [thoughtfully] Sometimes your biggest failure becomes your, um... your most important credential. [warm] Funny how that works."
