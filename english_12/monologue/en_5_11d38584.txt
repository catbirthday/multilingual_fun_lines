=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [gasp softly] Oh my God. It passed. It actually—they voted yes. Three hundred and twelve to ninety-four. [pause] I can't... mmm, I need to sit down for a second. [shaky voice] Seven years. Seven years of my life, and it's really happening. [laugh] 

You know what's crazy? I almost gave up, like, so many times. Remember last March when they killed it in committee? [bitter] I was ready to just... I don't know, walk away from all of it. But then I'd think about, um... about all those families who reached out. The letters, the—God, that little girl in Missouri whose mom couldn't afford her insulin. [sniffle]

[very quietly] Twenty-three million people. That's how many this helps. Twenty-three million. I keep saying the number but it doesn't feel, er... it doesn't feel real yet. [relieved] No more choosing between medicine and rent. No more rationing doses. 

[crying while speaking] My dad would've been so proud. He died fighting for this, you know? Not literally but—well, in a way, yeah. The stress of it all. [pause] And now it's law. Actual law. [laugh hysterically] 

I should probably call the team. They're all waiting to hear. [exhausted] But I just need one more minute to, mmm... to let it sink in. We did it. We actually fucking did it.
