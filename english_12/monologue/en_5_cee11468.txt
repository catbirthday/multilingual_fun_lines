=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [hesitantly] I've been wanting to tell you something for a while now. [pause] You probably didn't even realize you were doing it, but when I was going through my divorce last year, you were— [emotional] you were the only person who didn't try to fix everything. [sniffle] Everyone else kept giving advice or telling me I'd be better off or whatever, but you just... listened. [warm] You'd ask how I was doing and actually wait for the real answer. [laugh] Remember that day I completely broke down in the break room? [very sincerely] You just sat there with me. Didn't say a word about pulling myself together or being professional. [pause] And those little check-ins, just a "hey, thinking of you" text or bringing me coffee without me asking— [crying while speaking] God, I'm sorry, I'm getting all emotional about this. [deep breath] It's just that I don't think I would've made it through without that, without, um... without knowing someone understood that some days were just really hard. [relieved] The divorce is final now, and I'm actually doing okay. [smiling speaking] Better than okay, honestly. [very quietly] But I needed you to know that your patience, your understanding, it saved me. [passionately] It really did. Thank you.
