Subject: Your banquet for the children's hospital raising twice the expected funds

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [extremely happy] Oh my God, I just... I can't even process this right now. We raised twice what we expected! [laugh] Twice! The final count came in at, um... two hundred and forty thousand dollars. We were hoping for one-twenty, maybe one-thirty if we were lucky, but this is just... [gasp softly] I keep looking at the numbers thinking I'm reading them wrong. 

You know what gets me? [warm] It's thinking about what this actually means. Like, that's... hmm, that's probably another twenty beds for the pediatric wing. Or maybe, er, we could finally get that new MRI machine they've been needing. [sniffle] Sorry, I'm getting a bit emotional here.

[relieved] The whole night I was so nervous, you know? I kept thinking, what if nobody shows up? What if the caterer messes up? What if— [chuckle] God, I was such a wreck. And then people just kept coming, and the auction bids kept going higher, and... I don't know, it felt like everyone really got it. Like they understood what we were trying to do.

[very sincerely] Those kids are going to have so much more now. That's what matters. That's all that matters.
