I literally had to sit down. [sniffle] All those kids are going to get, um, they're going to get so much more than we even hoped for. The MRI machine, the specialized beds, the— [crying while speaking] sorry, I'm getting emotional but it's just... these are actual lives we're changing.\n\n[cheerful] And everyone who showed up tonight!
