=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [warm] You know, I was looking at some old photos yesterday. Found that one from your high school graduation—you looked so serious, remember? [chuckle] And I just kept thinking about... about everything that's happened since then. All the choices you've made. [pause] I know I haven't always said this right, or said it enough, but I'm so proud of you. [very sincerely] Not just for the big things, the accomplishments, though those are wonderful too. But for who you are. The way you treat people. The way you stand up for what's right even when it's, um... even when it's hard. [shaky voice] You became this incredible person, and I keep wondering how I got so lucky. Did I do something right? [laugh] Maybe it was all you. [sniffle] I watch you navigate the world with such grace and strength, and I think—that's my kid. That's my baby who used to refuse to eat anything but mac and cheese. [smiling speaking] And now look at you. You're everything I hoped you'd be and so much more. [quietly] I just wanted you to know that. Before I forget to say it again.
