=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [warm] You know what's funny? I almost didn't do it. This guy comes in with this ancient phone, screen completely shattered, and he's counting out change on the counter. [pause] And I'm thinking, this is gonna take me at least an hour, maybe two. But then he mentions—he mentions his daughter. [quietly] Haven't talked to her in three years, he says. Has her number written on this crumpled piece of paper. [sigh] So I tell him, don't worry about the money, I'll fix it. And he just... his whole face changes. [emotional] Two hours later, I'm watching this man hear his daughter's voice for the first time in years. Right there in my shop. [shaky voice] She started crying, he started crying, I'm trying not to cry. [laugh] They talked for maybe twenty minutes, and she's, um... she's coming to get him tomorrow. Taking him home. [very sincerely] I keep thinking about how close he was to throwing that phone away. How many people walk past him every day. And all it took was fixing some glass and a charging port. [pause] Sometimes the smallest things aren't small at all, you know?
