=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: God, driving down Main Street feels so different now. [nostalgic] When I was a kid, this street seemed endless—like it went on forever. [chuckle] Now I can see from the hardware store all the way to the diner in what, thirty seconds? [confused] How did I not notice this before? [pause] I mean, I've been living in Chicago for twelve years, working at the firm, making partner last year. [proudly] People there actually know my name, you know? [trailing off] But here it's just... [very quietly] Everyone I went to high school with is still here. [melancholic] Sarah's working at her dad's insurance place, Tommy never left his parents' basement. [sigh] And they all look at me like I'm some kind of alien now. [bitter] "Oh, look who came back to visit us little people." [frustrated] That's not what I— I didn't come back to show off or anything. [hesitantly] My mom needed help after the surgery, and I thought, um... I thought maybe I'd feel something coming back. [sad] Like maybe I'd remember why I loved it here once. But it's just three traffic lights, one grocery store, and the same conversations about the weather and who's dating who. [very slowly] Everything that felt so important here feels so... small. [whispering] I used to dream about escaping this place. [regretful] Now I'm realizing maybe I never really left—I just, uh, carried it with me the whole time.
