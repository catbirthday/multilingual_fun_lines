Subject: Winning the argument with your professor about outdated curriculum but getting blacklisted by other faculty

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] So I was right. I mean, completely right about everything—the curriculum hasn't been updated since 2008, the case studies are irrelevant, and... [pause] everyone in that room knew it. [frustrated] But now suddenly I'm the problem? [laugh] Dr. Harrison had to admit in front of the whole department that yes, we're teaching students frameworks that literally don't exist anymore. [triumphant] And the look on his face when I pulled up those industry reports—God, that was satisfying. [sigh] But now, um... now none of them will even look at me in the hallway. [upset] Three professors have "coincidentally" removed me from their research projects this week. [sarcastic] Super subtle, right? [anxious] And I keep hearing whispers about how I'm "difficult to work with" and, uh... "disrespectful to senior faculty." [angry] Disrespectful? For pointing out that we're failing our students? [laugh hysterically] The irony is that Dr. Harrison actually thanked me afterwards—privately, of course—said I was brave for speaking up. [very quietly] But then he warned me to watch my back because... well, because this is how academia works. [regretful] I don't know, maybe I should've just... kept my mouth shut? [bitter] No. No, someone had to say it. [trailing off] Even if it means I'll never get a recommendation letter from anyone in this department...
