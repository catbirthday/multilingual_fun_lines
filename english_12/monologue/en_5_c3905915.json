Seven years of— [bitter] of kissing ass and missing birthdays and answering emails at 2 AM. [laugh] And now it's mine. [confused] But I'm sitting here in my car and I just... I don't feel anything? [frustrated] No, that's not true. I feel something, it's just, um... it's not happiness. [sigh] When did this happen? When did I start dreading Monday meetings more than Sunday scares? [speaking fast] Every single day feels exactly the same—budget reviews, campaign metrics, arguing about fonts in PowerPoint presentations. [sarcastic] Living the dream. [long pause] The salary bump is incredible though. [regretful] Mom would be so proud. [quietly] She always said I'd make something of myself. [angry] But for what? So I can spend another seven years pretending to care about Q4 projections? [shaky voice] I think I've been running on autopilot for, uh... for maybe two years now? [cry] Just going through the motions. [exhausted] And this promotion, this thing I wanted so badly— [trailing off] it's just... it's just a fancier cage. [whispering] What am I doing with my life?"
