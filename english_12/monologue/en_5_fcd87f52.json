[pause] The privatization, the corporate deals, the exact same corrupt system we were supposed to be dismantling. I mean, I don't—how does that even happen? [confused] We had principles, right? Or was I just, um... was I the only one who actually believed them?\n\n[frustrated] I keep reading the statement over and over, thinking maybe I'm misunderstanding something. But no, it's right there in black and white. [laugh] God, I sound so naive. Like, of course this would happen. [bitter] Of course the moment they got a taste of real power, they'd sell out everything we stood for.\n\nYou know what the worst part is? [very sad] I turned down actual paying jobs for this. Good ones. I missed my daughter's recitals, my mom's birthday dinners, because I thought—hmm, I genuinely thought we were changing things. [sigh] And now what? Now I'm just another idiot who wasted half their life on a lie.\n\n[quietly] Maybe that's too harsh. Maybe they had reasons I don't understand yet. But honestly? [angry] I don't think I want to understand. I think I'm done trying to understand."
