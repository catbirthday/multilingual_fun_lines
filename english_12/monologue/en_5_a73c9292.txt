Subject: The nonprofit director position you've held for five years is being eliminated due to funding cuts

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] Five years. Five years I've been running this place and they just... they just tell me the position is being eliminated. [pause] Not "we're letting you go" or "your performance wasn't adequate" but "the position is being eliminated." Like I'm just a, um... a line item on a spreadsheet. [bitter] Budget cuts, they said. As if I haven't been stretching every dollar, working sixty hour weeks, basically living at that office. [sigh] 

And the kids—God, what happens to the after-school program now? [upset] We finally got them to trust us, to show up consistently, and now what? They're just supposed to find somewhere else to go? [pause] I keep thinking about Maria's face when I tell her. She's been coming since she was eight. 

[exhausted] I don't even know how to start looking for something else. This wasn't just a job, it was... I mean, every grant I wrote, every family we helped—that was my life. [quietly] Maybe I'm being dramatic but I really thought we were making a difference. [long pause]

[resigned] They're keeping me on for two more weeks. Two weeks to wrap up five years. To hand over everything I built to, um... to nobody, I guess. [sad] Because the position doesn't exist anymore.
