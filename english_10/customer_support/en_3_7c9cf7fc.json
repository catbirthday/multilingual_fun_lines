Your case reference will be STU-994821-P and that basically means it gets human eyes instead of just the automated system which, between you and me, rejects stuff for really dumb reasons sometimes."

Plus there's this thing where... hmm, what's the word... like a loyalty bonus that kicks in after three orders?"
