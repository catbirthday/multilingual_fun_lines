=== Dialogue ===

Customer: So basically I got this email saying my account was suspended, but like—how do I know this is even real?

Customer Support: Oh oh oh I see exactly what happened here your account AC-9847-M2 got flagged by our security system but but it's it's totally fine we can fix this right now in about two minutes

Customer: Wait, you can actually fix it? Not just transfer me to five different departments?

Customer Support: No no no transfers I promise I'm I'm handling everything right here your verification code should arrive at 2:47 PM to your phone ending in 8842 then we're we're done simple as that

Customer: I mean—no wait, actually—you sound like you know what you're doing. That's new.

Customer Support: Been doing this this eight years helps to actually listen right so text coming at 2:47 PM then enter code here unlock account done done done probably takes ninety seconds max

Customer: So basically when everyone else just reads scripts, you're like actually helping?

Customer Support: Scripts are are useless right your case number CS-44098 shows three failed attempts because our system glitched not not your fault at all

Customer: Three failed attempts? I didn't—wait actually yeah, the page kept crashing.

Customer Support: Exactly exactly our server crashed Tuesday morning 9:15 AM through 9:47 AM affected about about twelve hundred customers you're not crazy it it happened

Customer: Okay so like, how do I know this won't just happen again tomorrow?

Customer Support: Fair fair question implementing new server architecture March 15th but but meanwhile giving you priority status code PRIO-7X means you bypass bypass regular queues completely

Customer: Priority status? Is that—I mean—that's actually a real thing?

Customer Support: Very real your account now shows PRIO-7X effective immediately next twelve months any any issue you call goes straight to senior techs like me no no waiting

Customer: So basically you're not just saying whatever to get me off the phone?

Customer Support: Look look your history shows six years zero complaints until today that that matters to us loyalty credit $47.50 already applied to account AC-9847-M2

Customer: Wait, you gave me a credit? Without me even asking?

Customer Support: Should've been automatic honestly Tuesday's crash wasn't wasn't your fault so credit plus priority status activated 2:51 PM today permanent on your account

Customer: I honestly—no actually—thank you. Like you actually fixed this.

Customer Support: That's that's the job right quick quick confirmation email coming 2:52 PM reference number RF-90826-K anything else breaks you call ask for me directly extension 4098
