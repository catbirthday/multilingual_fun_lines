=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I cancelled our venue reservation three days ago but haven't received any confirmation. Our event was scheduled for this Saturday.

Customer Support: I understand your concern about the Saturday event. Let me locate your reservation immediately using your confirmation number or the name on the booking.

Customer: The original booking was under Harrison Industries, confirmation number VR-8847-L.

Customer Support: Thank you. I've pulled up reservation VR-8847-L for Harrison Industries, originally scheduled for Saturday, November 23rd at our downtown location for 150 guests.

Customer: That's correct. I submitted the cancellation online Tuesday morning but your system never sent the confirmation email.

Customer Support: I can see the cancellation was initiated at 9:47 AM on Tuesday, November 19th, but it appears the final processing step encountered a system error.

Customer: That's concerning. Does this mean I'm still financially responsible for the full amount?

Customer Support: Let me resolve this immediately. I'm completing the cancellation now and waiving the standard 72-hour cancellation fee of $450 given our system's failure to process your request properly.

Customer: I appreciate that. Can you confirm the full deposit will be refunded?

Customer Support: Absolutely.

Customer: When should I expect to see that refund processed?

Customer Support: Your deposit of $2,750 will be refunded to the card ending in 4429 within 5 to 7 business days, and you'll receive an email confirmation within the next hour.

Customer: Thank you. This has been stressful given how close we are to the event date.

Customer Support: I completely understand your concern. To ensure everything is properly documented, I'm sending you cancellation reference number CAN-9923-XLM along with a formal cancellation letter for your records.

Customer: That would be helpful. Will this show the cancellation was initiated on Tuesday as I requested?

Customer Support: Yes, the documentation will clearly show your original cancellation request from Tuesday, November 19th at 9:47 AM, along with today's completion timestamp and my agent ID SR-4012.

Customer: Perfect. I assume this means we have no remaining obligations or charges?

Customer Support: Correct. Your account balance is zero, all future charges have been cancelled, and you'll receive the full $2,750 deposit refund with no penalties.

Customer: Excellent. Thank you for resolving this quickly and professionally.

Customer Support: You're very welcome. You should receive the confirmation email at the address ending in @harrisonindustries.com within the hour, and please don't hesitate to call if you need anything else.
