=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I'm sorry, I'm probably just being stupid but I can't... the thing won't work?

Customer Support: Oh! No no no. Not at all. I'm so sorry you're having trouble. Let me... okay. Can you tell me what device we're looking at? And maybe your account number if you have it?

Customer: It's the new router thing you sent. I think my account is maybe... sorry, let me find...

Customer Support: That's totally fine! Take your time. Actually if you... if you look at the box? Should be a sticker. With like ROT-something and numbers. Probably starts ROT-4 or ROT-5.

Customer: ROT-4338? Is that... I mean that's probably not right...

Customer Support: That's perfect! ROT-4338-XL. Okay so. I'm looking at your account now. CID-78892-MK. And I see we sent this Tuesday? I'm really sorry if the setup instructions weren't... weren't clear enough.

Customer: No it's just me, I'm not good with these things so...

Customer Support: Actually? Between you and me. These new models are... they're kind of tricky. Even for us. So what exactly happens when you try to connect? Like do any lights come on?

Customer: There's a blue one? And then it goes red. Which seems bad probably.

Customer Support: Right right. Okay so. That's actually... that's telling us something specific. Your modem serial MX-90134-B needs a firmware push. Which sounds complicated but. I can do it from here. Takes maybe three minutes?

Customer: You can just... fix it? From there?

Customer Support: Yeah! Remotely. Through signal 447-229-8K. It's kind of... I mean technically you're supposed to do it yourself through the app? But honestly. This is easier. For both of us.

Customer: Look I pay quite a bit for this service, shouldn't this stuff just work?

Customer Support: You're absolutely right. And I'm... I'm really sorry. For a premium account like yours. Payment tier PT-3. This should be seamless. Let me just... okay pushing the update now.

Customer: Sorry I didn't mean to snap, I'm just frustrated with myself mostly...

Customer Support: No no! Don't apologize. Seriously. These things are designed badly. Firmware FK-2.9.4 updating now... should see the light flash green? Then back to blue?

Customer: Oh! Yes! It's doing that. So basically now what?

Customer Support: Perfect! So now. In about... thirty seconds? It'll restart. Then you can use password TEMP-8827-QM to connect. And then make your own password. Super simple.

Customer: That's it? God I feel silly. I probably should have just...

Customer Support: Honestly? You did exactly right calling. That firmware thing? Happens to like. Half our ROT-4000 series. Support ticket ST-90012 if you need reference. But you're all set now!
