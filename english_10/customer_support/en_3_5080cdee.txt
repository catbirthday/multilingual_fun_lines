=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I know this is. Um. Probably annoying but I just—I just need to understand what's covered.

Customer Support: Oh no, not annoying at all! *exhales* Honestly, insurance plans are confusing for everyone—I deal with them all day and still get mixed up sometimes. Let me pull up your policy number, it's showing as POL-4482-NK9, and we can go through everything together.

Customer: Thanks. Sorry it's—wait no, I mean—I'm just. Really tired of not knowing.

Customer Support: Mmm, I completely understand that exhaustion. So looking at your plan here... *soft breath* okay, you've got our Silver Plus coverage which has a $2,500 deductible, and then after that we cover 80% of most services until you hit your out-of-pocket maximum.

Customer: The the maximum is? God I should—sorry, I should know this.

Customer Support: Hey, no need to apologize—seriously, this stuff is intentionally complicated. Let me see here... your out-of-pocket max is $7,150 for the year, and hmm, looks like you've already met $1,823 of that so far.

Customer: Oh. Okay okay okay. So dental—no wait, is dental? Is dental part of this?

Customer Support: *sharp inhale* Ah, so dental is where it gets tricky. Your plan code SLV-PLUS-24 includes preventive dental only—so cleanings twice a year, basic X-rays—but fillings, crowns, that kind of thing would need separate coverage. What were you hoping to get done?

Customer: I think—no actually—just. Just a cleaning. Maybe.

Customer Support: Okay so that's good news then! Cleanings are fully covered, no copay. Hmm, and I can see... yeah, you haven't used either of your preventive visits this year, so you could schedule one anytime before December 31st.

Customer: Right. And vision is—sorry, the other—is vision separate too?

Customer Support: *soft exhale* Yeah, vision is also separate unfortunately. Let me check what you have... okay so your employer added basic vision as rider VIS-098, which gives you one exam per year plus $150 toward frames or contacts.

Customer: That's Tuesday—wait no, Wednesday. Wednesday they said something about mental health?

Customer Support: Ooh yes, mental health—that's actually where your plan is pretty decent. So with your coverage tier, therapy sessions have a $25 copay after you meet your deductible, and there's no visit limit which, honestly, is rare these days.

Customer: I'm sorry you have to. To explain all this. It's it's not your fault it's confusing.

Customer Support: Aw, you're really kind to say that. *breath* Look, between you and me? I think the whole system is backwards—we spend more time decoding coverage than actually helping people get care. Your confirmation number for this call is CNF-7739-XM if you need to reference anything we discussed.

Customer: Thanks. Um. Prescriptions. Are those?

Customer Support: Oh right, prescriptions! Let me see here... you've got a three-tier formulary, so generics are $10, preferred brands are $35, and non-preferred run about $75, though some specialty meds need prior auth through form PA-2847.

Customer: Okay. I just—I just want to. To know I'm covered if something happens.

Customer Support: *long exhale* I hear you, and that worry is so valid. Hmm, what if I email you a simplified breakdown? Not the legal document but like, a real person's guide to your coverage with our direct line 888-424-0931 if questions come up? Would that help ease some of that exhaustion?
