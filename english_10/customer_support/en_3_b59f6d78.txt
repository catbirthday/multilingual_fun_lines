Scenario: trying to redeem loyalty points that seem to have disappeared

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I need assistance with my loyalty account. I had twelve thousand points that are no longer showing.

Customer Support: Thank you for contacting us today. I'll be happy to investigate your loyalty points balance. May I have your membership number to access your account?

Customer: It's 4478-9021-3356. I last checked two weeks ago and everything was correct.

Customer Support: Perfect. I've located your account under membership 4478-9021-3356. I can see you currently show a balance of 482 points, but let me review your transaction history from the past 30 days.

Customer: Those points were accumulated over eighteen months. I was planning to redeem them for a flight upgrade.

Customer Support: I understand your concern. I'm seeing a debit transaction on November 12th at 2:47 PM for 11,518 points. The redemption code shows as RDM-7742-NK and appears to have been processed through our mobile app.

Customer: I didn't make any redemption on that date. Can you tell me what those points were used for?

Customer Support: Certainly.

Customer: I need this reversed immediately. This appears to be an unauthorized transaction on my account.

Customer Support: The points were redeemed for a digital gift card valued at $115.18 sent to an email address ending in gmail427. I'm escalating this to our fraud prevention team immediately under case number FRD-2024-11-8829.

Customer: That's not my email address. What steps are you taking to restore my points?

Customer Support: I've already initiated a full reversal. Your 11,518 points will be restored within 24 to 48 hours, and you'll receive confirmation at your registered email address. I'm also placing a security hold on your account to prevent further unauthorized access.

Customer: Good. Will I receive documentation showing this was fraudulent activity?

Customer Support: Absolutely. You'll receive a comprehensive fraud report under case FRD-2024-11-8829 within 5 business days. This will include all transaction details, the investigation findings, and confirmation of the point restoration.

Customer: What about the security of my account going forward? This shouldn't have been possible.

Customer Support: I agree completely. I'm implementing enhanced security protocol ES-7 on your account, which requires two-factor authentication for any redemption over 500 points. You'll also receive instant SMS alerts for all point transactions.

Customer: That's acceptable. Can you confirm when exactly I'll see the points restored to my balance?

Customer Support: Your points will be restored by November 16th at 11:59 PM Eastern Time. I've expedited your case to priority status P1, and you'll receive an SMS confirmation the moment the restoration is complete.

Customer: Thank you for handling this efficiently. I'll expect those confirmations and the fraud report.

Customer Support: You're very welcome. I've documented everything in your account and sent a detailed summary to your email. Our fraud team will contact you directly within 24 hours for any additional verification needed. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
