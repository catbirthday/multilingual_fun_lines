=== Dialogue ===

Customer: *exhale* So, um, last time I tried getting a discount it was a whole thing.

Customer Support: Oh yeah, I know exactly what you mean... the discount system is honestly kind of a mess sometimes. But let me pull up your account here with, er... what's your email or account number?

Customer: It's, uh, jchen4891 at gmail. Er, do you guys even honor student discounts anymore?

Customer Support: Yeah we definitely do! So I'm seeing your account ID is ACC-7744-BNX and, hmm, looks like you had some issues back in March with a verification thing... honestly our verification portal is, like, needlessly complicated.

Customer: *sharp inhale* Right, exactly. Um, so what do I need this time?

Customer Support: Okay so for student discount it's... hold on, they just changed this... ah here we go. You need to upload your student ID to our verification portal VRF-EDU-2024, and it has to show a current semester sticker or, uh, enrollment date that's within the last six months.

Customer: Uh, and if it gets rejected again? Because honestly I can't deal with another—

Customer Support: No no, I totally get it. Actually what I can do is... let me set up a priority review flag on your submission. Your case reference will be STU-994821-P and that basically means it gets human eyes instead of just the automated system which, between you and me, rejects stuff for really dumb reasons sometimes.

Customer: Oh. *exhale* Okay that's, er, that's actually helpful. Um, what about senior discounts though?

Customer Support: Senior discount is way easier actually—you just need to be 65 or older and, hmm... yeah it's automatic once I verify your birthdate. No portal nonsense or anything like that... Do you have someone who might qualify?

Customer: My mom, yeah. She's, uh, she's been trying to order but the prices are just—

Customer Support: Oh for sure, I mean, our regular prices are kind of... anyway, if she creates an account I can retroactively apply the senior code SEN-AUTO-15 to past orders too, going back, er... looks like up to 60 days.

Customer: Wait really? *sharp inhale* That would actually help a lot. Um, how much is the discount?

Customer Support: So students get 20% off with code EDU-VERIFY-20, and seniors get 15% but it stacks with our bulk discounts which... actually that's pretty good if she orders multiple items. Plus there's this thing where... hmm, what's the word... like a loyalty bonus that kicks in after three orders?

Customer: Er, okay. And this won't mysteriously stop working next month?

Customer Support: *laughs* Yeah I know, I know... Look, once you're verified in our system with confirmation VRF-COMPLETE, it's good for a full year. Though, uh, fair warning—the renewal process is admittedly kind of annoying, but at least you won't have to deal with it until next November.

Customer: *exhale* Alright. Um, you've actually been really helpful, not gonna lie.

Customer Support: Aw thanks! Honestly just trying to make this less painful than it needs to be... Oh actually, one more thing—if you text DISCOUNT to 555-829-4000, it'll send you both discount codes directly so you don't have to, like, dig through emails or whatever.

Customer: Oh perfect. Er, yeah, I'll do that. Thanks for not making this impossible.

Customer Support: Happy to help! And seriously, if the verification gives you any trouble, just reference that case number I gave you and, um... actually just ask for me directly, I'm extension 7412. We'll get it sorted one way or another.
