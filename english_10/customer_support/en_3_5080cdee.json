            "role": "Customer Support",
            "content": "Mmm, I completely understand that exhaustion. So looking at your plan here... *soft breath* okay, you've got our Silver Plus coverage which has a $2,500 deductible, and then after that we cover 80% of most services until you hit your out-of-pocket maximum."

        {
            "role": "Customer Support",
            "content": "*sharp inhale* Ah, so dental is where it gets tricky. Your plan code SLV-PLUS-24 includes preventive dental only—so cleanings twice a year, basic X-rays—but fillings, crowns, that kind of thing would need separate coverage. What were you hoping to get done?"

            "role": "Customer Support",
            "content": "Okay so that's good news then! Cleanings are fully covered, no copay. Hmm, and I can see... yeah, you haven't used either of your preventive visits this year, so you could schedule one anytime before December 31st."

            "role": "Customer Support",
            "content": "*soft exhale* Yeah, vision is also separate unfortunately. Let me check what you have... okay so your employer added basic vision as rider VIS-098, which gives you one exam per year plus $150 toward frames or contacts."

        {
            "role": "Customer Support",
            "content": "Ooh yes, mental health—that's actually where your plan is pretty decent. So with your coverage tier, therapy sessions have a $25 copay after you meet your deductible, and there's no visit limit which, honestly, is rare these days."
        },
        {
            "role": "Customer",

            "role": "Customer Support",
            "content": "Aw, you're really kind to say that. *breath* Look, between you and me? I think the whole system is backwards—we spend more time decoding coverage than actually helping people get care. Your confirmation number for this call is CNF-7739-XM if you need to reference anything we discussed."

            "role": "Customer Support",
            "content": "Oh right, prescriptions! Let me see here... you've got a three-tier formulary, so generics are $10, preferred brands are $35, and non-preferred run about $75, though some specialty meds need prior auth through form PA-2847."

Not the legal document but like, a real person's guide to your coverage with our direct line 888-424-0931 if questions come up? Would that help ease some of that exhaustion?"
