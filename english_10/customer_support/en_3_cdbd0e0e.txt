=== Dialogue ===

Customer: I've been a customer for six years. Six. And you're telling me the price just changes on its own?

Customer Support: *sharp inhale* Okay. So. Between you and me? The system does this thing with dynamic pricing—account number ending in 7742, right? Your rate adjustment kicked in Tuesday at 2:47 PM. Technically supposed to notify you 72 hours before but. You know. System glitches.

Customer: It's it's not right. Just not. I budget. I plan. This is wrong.

Customer Support: Listen. I get it. Here's what happened—your loyalty discount LYD-4829-X expired. But. Good news. I can see three other discounts you qualify for. Want the insider move? Stack codes SAVE20 and MEMBER15. Better than what you had before.

Customer: Wait wait wait. Expired? Nobody said anything about expiring.

Customer Support: *exhale* Right. So. Price protection plan PPL-9847 would've prevented this. Locks your rate for 24 months. Costs nothing. They don't advertise it because. Well. You can figure out why. Want me to backdate it to last month?

Customer: You can do that? I mean—is that even allowed?

Customer Support: Allowed? *soft breath* Technically? No. Will I do it for a six-year customer? Your new confirmation is CNF-7739-BK22. Already processed. Rate locked at $47.99 through December 2025.

Customer: Oh. I'm sorry, I'm just—this whole thing caught me off guard. Forty-seven ninety-nine?

Customer Support: Yep. Down from the fifty-three twelve you were about to pay. See. Sometimes the system works out. Your account shows 14,788 loyalty points too. Another secret? Convert those before January. Policy change coming.

Customer: Okay okay okay. Convert them to what exactly?

Customer Support: Account credits. Gift cards. Whatever. Point is. *inhale* After January first? Conversion rate drops from 100-to-1 to 150-to-1. That's a 33% haircut. Your 14,788 points are worth $147.88 today. Next month? Ninety-eight fifty-two.

Customer: They don't tell us any of this. None of it. It's it's wrong.

Customer Support: *long exhale* Look. Welcome to the game. Your account dashboard—access code AXS-9982-7M—has a hidden menu. Click "billing preferences" three times fast. Opens the real control panel. Everything's there.

Customer: Three times fast? Are you serious right now?

Customer Support: Dead serious. Easter egg from the dev team. Been there since 2019. Also. While you're in there? Toggle "grandfathered pricing" to ON. Reference number REF-4401-XX9. Never expires if you don't touch it.

Customer: I just—I just feel stupid. Should've known about this stuff.

Customer Support: Nah. Don't. System's designed to be confusing. That's the whole point. But now? You're ahead of 98% of customers. Your new rate structure RST-7734-K locks in. Saves you. Let me calculate. Four hundred seventeen dollars annually.

Customer: Four hundred seventeen? That's. Wow. Okay. Thanks. Really.

Customer Support: No problem. One more thing. *quick breath* Survey comes tomorrow. Score anything you want. But. Comments section? Type "OVERRIDE-8829". Gets you priority support tier. Forever. Don't spread that around though. Deal?
