Scenario: asking to speak with a manager after previous call was disconnected

=== Dialogue ===

Customer: Look, I just—I need a manager. Now. Got disconnected twenty minutes ago.

Customer Support: Oh absolutely absolutely I hear you and I'm pulling up your account right now just need your phone number ending in the last four digits so I can see what happened with that previous call and honestly we're gonna get this sorted right away no question about it

Customer: It's 7-7-3—wait no, 7-7-9-3. Been on hold forever.

Customer Support: *sharp inhale* Okay wow yeah I can see here in the system log CALL-ID-48392-B that you were with Marcus for seventeen minutes before the disconnect and that should NOT have happened I mean this is exactly the kind of thing where I'm already escalating internally while we're talking because that's just not acceptable

Customer: Can't do this anymore. Three hours. Three. Today alone.

Customer Support: Right right absolutely not

Customer: Let me see here... manager's what, ten more minutes? Twenty? How's this work exactly?

Customer Support: *exhale* So here's what I'm doing instead because waiting is the last thing you need right now I've got override authority up to level L4-COMP which means I can handle probably ninety percent of what a manager would do anyway and I'm already seeing your case history here REF-20241108-KP and this is definitely something we need to fix immediately

Customer: Started simple. Just wanted my refund. That's it. That's all.

Customer Support: And you're going to get it I mean look at this your original request RMA-7764-X from November 3rd should've been processed already this is sitting here in pending status for absolutely no good reason and that's weird actually let me dig into why that got stuck

Customer: It's rent money—sorry, that's... shouldn't dump that on you.

Customer Support: No no no this matters this is exactly why I'm pushing this through right now not making you wait another second because I can see the refund amount is $847.92 and that's not trivial money that's real money that affects real life and honestly the fact that our system dropped your call earlier makes this even more urgent

Customer: Hmm, what if... can you just override it? Skip the manager thing?

Customer Support: That's exactly what I'm doing

Customer: Oh. Okay so that means... wait, you're actually fixing it? Right now?

Customer Support: *sharp inhale* Already processing literally as we speak I've initiated instant transfer protocol ITP-RUSH-2847 which bypasses the standard three to five day wait and you should see this hit your account within two to four hours maximum and I'm also adding a courtesy credit code DELAY50 for the inconvenience because three hours of your time is unacceptable

Customer: Can't believe—I mean, Marcus said impossible. Said it's just—wait no, Tuesday. Policy thing.

Customer Support: Yeah well Marcus was wrong and I'm looking at his notes here from ticket TKT-98341-M and respectfully he missed about four different ways to resolve this so what I'm doing is documenting everything in your file with priority flag PF-EXECUTIVE so if anything goes sideways which it won't but if it does any agent who pulls this up will see exactly what needs to happen

Customer: Let me see here... confirmation number? Need something. Proof. Please.

Customer Support: Absolutely yes your confirmation is CNF-44789-PRIORITY and I'm emailing it right now plus texting it to your phone ending in 7793 and honestly if you don't see that money by let's say 6 PM today I want you calling back asking for me specifically I'm Jordan employee ID JRD-4429 and we will absolutely escalate this further but I really don't think that's gonna be necessary because it's processing right now
