Scenario: A demon returns to their former haunt after centuries away, only to find a specter has been bound there by the demon's own ancient curse, waiting all this time for their return.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [whispering] This place hasn't changed at all, still the same crumbling stones and... [gasps] wait, there's something here, someone I didn't expect to find after all these centuries.

Character 2: [very quietly] You finally came back, Malphas. [slowly] I've been counting the sunrises through these broken windows for three hundred and forty-seven years, waiting for the one who bound me here.

Character 1: [shocked] Elara? [shaky voice] No, that's impossible, you were mortal when I... [trailing off] the binding spell was meant for my enemies, not for you, never for you.

Character 2: [warmly] The curse caught me when I tried to follow you through the portal that night. [pause] My body died but my soul couldn't leave, tethered to this place by your own magic, watching seasons turn to decades, decades to centuries.

Character 1: [regretful] I never knew.

Character 2: [empathetically] How could you have known? [slowly] You were fighting a war against heaven itself, and I was just a human who loved a demon, foolish enough to think I could help somehow.

Character 1: [anxious] But you've been alone here all this time, trapped in these ruins because of my carelessness? [very quietly] I left protection spells everywhere, but I never thought to check who might already be inside them.

Character 2: [drifting] Alone isn't quite accurate anymore. [chuckles] After the first century, you learn to find company in dust motes dancing in sunbeams, in the mice that nest in the walls, in memories that replay like broken music boxes.

Character 1: [desperately] I can break the binding right now, release you to whatever afterlife awaits. [quickly] Just say the word and I'll tear apart every spell I wove into these stones, even if it costs me.

Character 2: [hesitantly] After waiting this long, the thought of leaving terrifies me more than staying. [sighs] What if there's nothing beyond this? What if I dissolve into nothing the moment your magic releases its hold?

Character 1: [very softly] You're afraid to be free because this prison has become your entire existence. [pause] God, Elara, what have I done to you?

Character 2: [lovingly] You gave me eternity to perfect my love for you, even if you never meant to. [laughs] Every ghost story needs a tragic romance, and ours spans centuries now, written in cobwebs and moonlight through broken glass.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] Don't romanticize this curse I put on you! [shaky voice] You should hate me for stealing your life, your death, your peace, everything that should have been yours.

Character 2: [peacefully] Hatred requires energy I learned to stop wasting around year fifty. [slowly] Now there's only this strange, translucent love that passes through me like light through water, neither warming nor cooling, just existing.

Character 1: [firmly] Then I'll stay here with you, in this place I accidentally made your tomb. [pause] If I can't free you without destroying you, then I'll share your imprisonment.

Character 2: You would bind yourself here? [gasps softly] After everything you fought to escape, all the freedom you won in your rebellion, you'd surrender it for a ghost who barely remembers how to be human?

Character 1: [warmly] I'm tired of freedom that means nothing without someone to share it with. [very quietly] Besides, demons have all the time in the world, and I've spent none of it on anything that mattered until now.

Character 2: [whispering] Then stay, but know that loving a specter means loving echoes and shadows. [sighs] I can't touch you, can't warm you, can't be anything more than a voice in the darkness and a shimmer in the light.

Character 1: [lovingly] I've touched enough in my existence to know that the deepest connections require no flesh at all. [chuckles] We'll haunt this place together, you and I, until the stones themselves crumble to dust.

Character 2: [delighted] Then welcome home, my dark angel. [slowly] Let me show you how I've mapped every crack in the ceiling, named every spider in the corners, and learned to dance with the drafts that whistle through these halls.
