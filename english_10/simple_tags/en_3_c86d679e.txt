Scenario: A billionaire tech CEO arrives at the pool after hours to inform their daughter's long-time swim coach that she'll be leaving competitive swimming to join the family business.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [confidently] Coach Martinez, I appreciate you meeting me after hours like this. [clears throat] I know you've been working with Sophia for, what, six years now? But we need to discuss her future direction.

Character 2: [curious] Of course, Mr. Chen, though I have to say this feels unusually formal for our typical conversations about Sophia's training schedule. [pause] Is everything alright with her shoulder injury from regionals?

Character 1: [formally] Her shoulder's fine, actually, but that's, um, somewhat beside the point now. [firmly] Sophia will be transitioning away from competitive swimming after this season to begin her internship at our Singapore office.

Character 2: [confused] Wait, I'm sorry, transitioning away? [quietly] She just qualified for Junior Nationals and we've been discussing NCAA recruitment strategies for months now—Stanford's scout was literally here last week watching her.

Character 1: [dismissive] Yes, well, college athletics is a nice hobby but it's time she focuses on real-world skills, you know? [confidently] The tech industry waits for no one, and she needs to establish herself while our family still has market influence.

Character 2: [frustrated] A hobby? [exhales] Mr. Chen, your daughter has Olympic trial potential—she's dropping two seconds off her butterfly every season, and you're calling four-hour daily training sessions for six years a hobby?

Character 1: [condescending] Look, I understand you're invested in this, and we'll certainly compensate you for the remainder of the contracted sessions. [quickly] But surely you can see that making executive decisions at eighteen trumps swimming laps in chlorinated water.

Character 2: Have you, um, actually discussed this with Sophia? Because yesterday she was asking me about altitude training camps for next summer and talking about breaking the state record—she didn't mention Singapore or internships at all.

Character 1: [stern] Sophia is seventeen and doesn't fully grasp what doors I'm opening for her right now. [pause] A guaranteed C-suite track versus maybe making an Olympic team someday? That's not really a choice.

Character 2: [bitter] You know what's interesting? [sighs] In six years, I've seen you at exactly three meets, but somehow you're an expert on what this sport means to your daughter and what she's capable of achieving.

Character 1: [defensive] I run four companies across three continents, Coach. [loudly] My absence from swim meets doesn't mean I don't know what's best for my daughter's future—I'm securing generational wealth here, not collecting participation trophies.

Character 2: [passionately] Generational wealth? Your daughter cried for twenty minutes in my office after winning States because you didn't even text congratulations. [quietly] She doesn't want your money, Mr. Chen, she wants you to see who she actually is.

Character 1: [angrily] That's quite enough. [very firmly] You're her swim coach, not her therapist, and frankly, filling her head with Olympic fantasies when she has real responsibilities waiting is borderline irresponsible of you.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Fantasies? She's ranked third nationally in her age group! [exhales] But you're right about one thing—I'm just her coach, though apparently I know her dreams better than her own father does.

Character 1: [coldly] Dreams don't pay bills.

Character 2: [sad] No, but they're the reason she gets up at four-thirty every morning, even Sundays, even her birthday. [very quietly] They're the reason she keeps pushing through injuries and setbacks that would break most adults I know.

Character 1: [firmly] Well, after next month she can sleep in like a normal teenager. [pause] I'll have my assistant send over the termination paperwork and your severance details by end of business tomorrow.

Character 2: [resigned] Fine, but, um, can I at least ask one thing? [pleading] Let her tell me herself—don't make her just disappear from the pool one day without saying goodbye to her teammates and, honestly, to me.

Character 1: [sighs] I suppose that's reasonable enough. [formally] She can finish out the month, but after that, Coach Martinez, her future is in boardrooms, not swimming pools, whether either of you likes it or not.

Character 2: [very quietly] You know what the saddest part is, Mr. Chen? [pause] Sophia could've had both—the boardroom and the pool—but you've decided she has to choose, and worse, you've chosen for her.
