            "role": "Character 1",
            "content": "[dismissive] Yes, well, college athletics is a nice hobby but it's time she focuses on real-world skills, you know? [confidently] The tech industry waits for no one, and she needs to establish herself while our family still has market influence."

            "content": "[condescending] Look, I understand you're invested in this, and we'll certainly compensate you for the remainder of the contracted sessions. [quickly] But surely you can see that making executive decisions at eighteen trumps swimming laps in chlorinated water."

            "role": "Character 2",
            "content": "[shaky voice] Fantasies? She's ranked third nationally in her age group! [exhales] But you're right about one thing—I'm just her coach, though apparently I know her dreams better than her own father does."
