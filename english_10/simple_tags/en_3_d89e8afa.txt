Scenario: A travel agent meets with a former client who lost everything in a house fire six months ago and is finally ready to book their first vacation since the tragedy.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [warm] Margaret, it's so good to see you back in the office again. [hesitantly] I heard about what happened with the house, the fire, everything you lost, and I just wanted to say how incredibly sorry I am.

Character 2: [quietly] The insurance check finally cleared last week, all hundred and forty thousand dollars of what used to be my life. [bitter] They said I should treat myself to something nice with part of it, as if a vacation could somehow replace thirty years of memories.

Character 1: [empathetically] Nobody's saying a trip will fix everything, but sometimes getting away from the constant reminders can help you breathe again. [gently] Where were you thinking of going, or are you still figuring that out?

Character 2: [shaky voice] My daughter keeps pushing me to go to Iceland because we had all these travel books about it that she saved from when she was little. [pause] They're gone now too, obviously, but she printed out pages from the internet and made me a new book.

Character 1: [softly] That's incredibly thoughtful of her, and Iceland in the spring is absolutely breathtaking with the lupine flowers blooming everywhere. [carefully] Would this be a solo trip, or were you thinking of bringing someone along for company?

Character 2: [defensive] Solo, definitely solo, because I can't handle being responsible for someone else's happiness right now when I can barely manage my own. [sighs] Is that pathetic, running away to another country because I can't stand looking at the empty lot where my house used to be?

Character 1: [firmly] There's nothing pathetic about needing space to process trauma, and honestly, some of my clients' most transformative journeys have been the ones they took alone. [reassuringly] Iceland's incredibly safe for solo travelers, especially women, and the locals are genuinely kind without being intrusive.

Character 2: How long should I go for?

Character 1: [thoughtfully] For a first trip after something this significant, I usually recommend ten to fourteen days because it's enough time to settle in without feeling overwhelming. [pause] You'll want at least a week to do the Ring Road properly, then maybe a few days in Reykjavik to decompress before coming home.

Character 2: The thing is, I keep thinking about booking it but then freezing up because what if something happens while I'm gone? [anxiously] What if there's another emergency and I'm thousands of miles away on some glacier, completely unreachable?

Character 1: [gently] That fear makes complete sense after what you've been through, but Iceland has excellent cell coverage even in remote areas, and I can book you flexible tickets that allow same-day returns if needed. [calmly] We can also get comprehensive travel insurance that covers emergency flights home for any family crisis.

Character 2: [frustrated] God, more insurance, because the last policy worked out so well for me, right? [sighs] Sorry, that's not fair to you, I know you're just trying to help and I'm being difficult about everything.

Character 1: [kindly] You're not being difficult at all, you're being human, and frankly, I'd be more concerned if you weren't having these reactions. [sincerely] Look, why don't we start by just looking at some photos and talking about possibilities without any pressure to book anything today?

Character 2: My therapist says I need to stop living in this suspended state where I'm neither moving forward nor properly grieving. [quietly] She thinks the trip might help me figure out who I am now that everything that defined me is literally ash.

Character 1: [carefully] There's something powerful about being in a place where nobody knows your story, where you can just exist without the weight of other people's pity or expectations. [warmly] Iceland's landscape has this raw, volcanic beauty that somehow makes human problems feel both smaller and more manageable.

Character 2: [trembling] The fire started in my study where I kept all our family photos, forty years of Christmas mornings and birthday parties and first days of school. [crying while speaking] I used to spend hours planning imaginary trips from those old National Geographic magazines, and now I have all this money to actually go, but no photos to remember why I wanted to.

Character 1: [very gently] Margaret, those memories aren't gone just because the physical photos are, and maybe this trip isn't about replacing what you lost but about creating something entirely new. [softly] What if we found you a lovely guesthouse with a host family who could teach you some Icelandic cooking or knitting, something tactile and real?

Character 2: Book it.

Character 1: [surprised] Really? [quickly] Okay, let me pull up the availability for late April when the weather's milder but you'll still catch the tail end of Northern Lights season if you're lucky. [hopefully] This feels like a good step, Margaret.

Character 2: [exhausted] I'm so tired of being the woman whose house burned down, the tragedy everyone whispers about at the grocery store. [firmly] Maybe in Iceland I can just be another tourist taking too many photos of sheep and waterfalls, building a new collection of memories that nobody can burn.
