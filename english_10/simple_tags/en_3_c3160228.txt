Scenario: A voice actor discovers their estranged sibling, now a mining engineer, trapped underground during a cave-in while recording audio samples for a documentary about the abandoned mine.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shocked] Marcus? Is that—oh my God, is that really you down there? [loudly] I was just recording ambient sound for this documentary when I heard the collapse, and I, um, I never imagined you'd be the one trapped.

Character 2: [shaky voice] Sam? What the hell are you doing here? [coughs] Look, I don't have time for whatever this is—the support beam shifted about twenty minutes ago and I've got maybe an hour before this whole section comes down.

Character 1: [anxiously] Okay, okay, let me think. [quickly] I've already called 911 but they said it'll take at least two hours to get the specialized rescue team here from the city, which means, uh, we need to figure something out ourselves.

Character 2: [bitter] Of course you'd show up now, after eight years of silence, when I'm literally buried alive. [exhales] You always did have perfect timing for making everything about you, didn't you?

Character 1: [firmly] Stop. Just stop.

Character 2: [frustrated] There's an old ventilation shaft about fifteen feet to my left, but it's partially blocked with debris. [groans] If you could somehow clear it from your end, I might, um, I might be able to squeeze through before everything collapses.

Character 1: [desperately] Tell me exactly what to look for up here—I can see three different shaft openings but they're all rusted shut. [pause] God, Marcus, I'm so sorry about dad's funeral, I should have been there, I should have—

Character 2: [quietly] The middle one, with the yellow hazard paint that's mostly peeled off. [sighs] And yeah, well, Mom needed you there, not me—she made that pretty clear when she didn't even tell me you weren't coming.

Character 1: [upset] That's not true and you know it! [shaky voice] I was in Prague finishing the audiobook series that basically saved my career, and by the time I got her message it was, it was already too late to get back.

Character 2: Right, your career—always the priority. [coughs] Look, just, can you focus on the shaft? I can hear the rock shifting down here and it's, uh, it's getting worse.

Character 1: [crying while speaking] I'm trying to pry it open but it's completely rusted—wait, wait, there's a crowbar in my car. [loudly] Marcus, I need you to know something in case this doesn't, um, in case we don't have time.

Character 2: [very quietly] Sam, don't do this now. [pause] Just get the crowbar and get me out of here, and then we can have whatever conversation you've been rehearsing in your head for the last eight years.

Character 1: [passionately] No, you need to hear this—I left because I couldn't watch you turn into Dad, obsessed with these mines, with proving something to dead men. [voice breaking] And now you're literally going to die in the same tunnels that killed him.

Character 2: [angrily] I'm nothing like him! [exhales] I became an engineer to make these places safe, to prevent what happened to him from happening to anyone else, but you wouldn't know that because you never asked, never called, never—[loud crash]

Character 1: [shouting] Marcus! Marcus, are you okay?

Character 2: [coughing] The beam just dropped another foot—Sam, you need to hurry. [shaky voice] And for what it's worth, I, uh, I listened to every audiobook you narrated, even the terrible romance novels, just to hear your voice again.

Character 1: [warmly] You did? [exhales] God, Marcus, I've missed you so much—I've literally written you a hundred emails that I never sent because I didn't know how to say I was wrong.

Character 2: [very quietly] Get the crowbar, Sam. [firmly] We'll have time for apologies when I'm not about to be crushed—but yeah, I missed you too, you melodramatic idiot, every single day.

Character 1: [running footsteps, breathless] I'm coming back with it now—just hold on, okay? We're not finished, not like this, not when we finally have a chance to fix everything.

Character 2: [relieved] I can see light coming through—you got it open! [quickly] Okay, I'm going to try to climb up but the walls are unstable so if you hear anything collapse, just, um, just get clear and don't look back, promise me.
