Scenario: A citizen who lost their home to eminent domain confronts an audience member at a city council meeting who vocally supported the development project that displaced them.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [bitter] Oh, you're the one who stood up at every meeting cheering for the new shopping complex. [pause] The one who said displaced families were a necessary sacrifice for progress.

Character 2: [hesitantly] Look, I supported the development because the economic projections showed it would bring hundreds of jobs to the area and increase property values for everyone who—

Character 1: [angry] For everyone who still has property, you mean. [laughs bitterly] My family lived in that house for forty-seven years, three generations under one roof.

Character 2: [formal] The city offered fair market value compensation, and there were relocation assistance programs available to help families transition to new housing situations. [clears throat]

Character 1: [very loudly] Fair market value? They gave us sixty percent of what similar houses sold for two blocks away because ours was suddenly in a blighted zone!

Character 2: [frustrated] The area was deteriorating, the infrastructure was failing, and without development, the whole neighborhood would have continued to decline indefinitely.

Character 1: [mocking] Deteriorating? We had a community garden, a daycare center my grandmother founded, and neighbors who actually knew each other's names. [pause]

Character 2: [condescending] Those are nice sentiments, but nostalgia doesn't fix broken sewage systems or bring sustainable employment to struggling communities. [sighs]

Character 1: [furious] You sat there in your suburban home googling statistics while we were packing up photo albums and trying to explain to our kids why we had to leave!

Character 2: [hesitantly] I understand this is emotional for you, but progress requires difficult decisions, and the greater good sometimes means individual sacrifices have to be made.

Character 1: [sarcastic] The greater good. [exhales] Tell me, how many times have you driven past that shiny new complex you fought so hard for?

Character 2: [quietly] I drive past it on my commute every day actually, and the parking lot is always full, the stores are thriving, people are working there. [pause]

Character 1: [very quietly] People like my daughter.

Character 2: [confused] Your daughter works at the complex? But I thought you were against—

Character 1: [shaky voice] She stocks shelves at the grocery store that replaced our home. [laughs bitterly] Minimum wage, no benefits, but hey, at least she contributed to those employment numbers you love.

Character 2: [apologetic] I didn't realize the personal impact was so—I mean, the reports and projections don't really capture these individual stories, do they?

Character 1: [bitter] No, they don't capture my mother crying when the bulldozer hit our porch, or my son's nightmares about losing his room. [trailing off]

Character 2: [regretful] Maybe I should have visited the neighborhood before speaking at those meetings, actually met the families instead of just reviewing development proposals. [long pause]

Character 1: [exhausted] It's too late for maybe, but there's another eminent domain hearing next month for the east side. Those families deserve better advocates than they got.

Character 2: [very sincerely] Would you be willing to help me understand what questions I should be asking, what the reports don't show? [pause] I want to do better.
