Scenario: A guild master seeks out a banshee haunting the ruins where his guild was decimated, only to discover she is his transformed vice-captain who died saving the others.

=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [shaky voice] Elara? Is that really you beneath all that ethereal mist and those bone-white robes? [pause] The other survivors said a banshee haunted these ruins, but I never imagined it would be you.

Character 2: You shouldn't have come here, Marcus. [very melancholic] The living have no place among these broken stones where our guild fell apart that terrible night three months ago.

Character 1: Three months of nightmares, three months of wondering if I could have done something different to save you all. [bitter] And here you are, transformed into the very creature whose scream warned us too late.

Character 2: [whispering] My scream echoes here every night at the same hour we were ambushed. [louder] I can't stop it, can't control when the wailing begins—it's my curse for failing to protect everyone.

Character 1: [frustrated] You didn't fail anyone! You threw yourself between that demon lord and the rest of us, gave us time to escape while you—[voice breaking] while you died in my arms.

Character 2: [sad] Death would have been a mercy compared to this existence. [sighs] I'm bound here, watching the blood stains fade, counting the bones that were never properly buried.

Character 1: [regretful] We tried to come back for your body, but the dark magic had already consumed everything. [quietly] I've brought your guild medallion—thought maybe it would help you find peace somehow.

Character 2: [crying while speaking] That medallion represents oaths I can no longer keep, brothers and sisters I can no longer stand beside. [exhales] My transformation into this harbinger of death makes a mockery of everything we swore to protect.

Character 1: [warmly] The guild remembers you as a hero, not a monster. [firmly] Every new recruit hears the story of Vice-Captain Elara who gave everything to save her comrades.

Character 2: [bitter] Heroes don't become creatures that terrify travelers with their mourning cries. [laughs] Heroes get buried with honors, not trapped between worlds, unable to rest or truly die.

Character 1: [empathetically] Then let me help you find that rest. [determined] There must be something keeping you tethered here besides guilt—some unfinished business we can complete together.

Character 2: [hesitantly] The demon lord's essence... [gasps] It still pulses beneath the ruins.

Character 1: [anxious] You mean that thing survived? After all the damage we inflicted, after your sacrifice, it's still alive down there in some form?

Character 2: [very quietly] Not alive, but not truly dead either—like me. [pause] It feeds on the sorrow here, growing stronger each night when my banshee wail pierces the darkness.

Character 1: [confidently] Then we finish what we started three months ago. [passionately] Together this time—the living guild master and his transformed vice-captain against the demon that destroyed us.

Character 2: [softly] You would still fight beside me? [trembling] Even like this?

Character 1: [sincerely] I never stopped considering you my vice-captain, Elara. [chuckles] Death and transformation don't erase the bonds we forged through countless battles before that night.

Character 2: [relieved] Maybe that's why I couldn't move on—waiting for you to return, to forgive me for not being strong enough to save everyone AND survive.

Character 1: [gently] Forgive you? [sighs] Elara, I'm the one who needs forgiveness.

Character 2: [forgiving] There's nothing to forgive, Marcus. [warmly] We both did what we thought was right, and now we have a chance to truly end this nightmare together.
