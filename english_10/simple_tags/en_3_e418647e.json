[sighs] The doctor says it could last another two months, and I've tried everything—white noise machines, swaddling, those special bottles that reduce gas, even hired a sleep consultant who cost more than my car payment."

            "content": "[analytically] The complaints indicate noise disturbances primarily between eleven PM and four AM, with decibel readings reaching eighty-five according to one tenant's measurement app. [clearing throat] That's comparable to city traffic levels, which does exceed residential quiet hours standards."

I walk her around the apartment, I bounce on that stupid yoga ball until my back screams, I even tried driving her around at two AM but my neighbors complained about the car door slamming."

[exhales] They kept sending these formal letters with legal language about 'breach of peaceful enjoyment' and I haven't slept more than two hours straight in weeks, so reading legal threats while covered in spit-up isn't exactly helping my mental state."

[formally] This hearing is concluded, and Ms. Rodriguez, it does get better—both the colic and the sleeping, I promise you that from personal experience."
