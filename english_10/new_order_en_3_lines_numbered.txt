# Speaker Lines Only (English) - Actor 3
============================================================


# --- DIALOGUE ---
1. Oh yeah, the numbers are, um, definitely optimistic but that's kind of the point, you know? We need to show growth potential to the board, and honestly if we don't hit these targets, well, we'll just pivot the narrative next quarter.
2. Right right, but see, that's because we're, uh, repositioning our market approach—like, we're basically burning through cash now to capture market share later. It's all about that hockey stick growth curve, I mean, every successful company does this.
3. Absolutely.
4. [whispering loudly] Between you and me, the investors don't actually read these things that carefully anyway. They just want to see big numbers and, hmm, aggressive targets—it shows confidence, supposedly.
5. [furious] Look, I've been doing this for fifteen years, alright? You think I don't know what I'm doing here? This is how the game is played—you set impossible targets, you chase them hard, and, er, somehow it all works out in the end.
# --- SIMPLE_TAGS ---
6. You shouldn't have come here, Marcus. [very melancholic] The living have no place among these broken stones where our guild fell apart that terrible night three months ago.
7. [whispering] My scream echoes here every night at the same hour we were ambushed. [louder] I can't stop it, can't control when the wailing begins—it's my curse for failing to protect everyone.
8. [sad] Death would have been a mercy compared to this existence. [sighs] I'm bound here, watching the blood stains fade, counting the bones that were never properly buried.
9. [crying while speaking] That medallion represents oaths I can no longer keep, brothers and sisters I can no longer stand beside. [exhales] My transformation into this harbinger of death makes a mockery of everything we swore to protect.
10. [bitter] Heroes don't become creatures that terrify travelers with their mourning cries. [laughs] Heroes get buried with honors, not trapped between worlds, unable to rest or truly die.
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT ---
11. Oh no, that must be so unsettling to see. I completely understand why you'd be concerned. Let me pull up your account right away—can you give me the last four digits of your account number or the card ending?
12. Perfect, thank you. I'm pulling up account ending in 3847 right now and... okay I'm seeing some activity here that might explain what's happening. There was a hold placed at 11:47 PM last night for the full balance, transaction ID TRX-9K4M-8821. I know how alarming this must look...
13. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this. It looks like... well, it's showing as a merchant authorization from Pacific Gas & Electric for $2,127.43, which would be your entire balance. That seems unusually high for a utility payment...
14. Right, exactly, that doesn't make any sense at all. I've seen this happen before with utility companies where their system requests the wrong amount. Let me check something... your normal PG&E payments show as $97 monthly. This is definitely an error on their end.
15. I know this is incredibly frustrating. The hold should automatically release within 3-5 business days if PG&E doesn't collect it, but honestly... we don't need to wait that long. I can file an immediate dispute with reference number DSP-7QR9-CC42 and we should have this reversed within 24 hours...
# --- MONOLOGUE ---
16. [confused] Are you seriously telling me right now that you don't have space? It's midnight. It's literally midnight and you're just now—wait, you knew this whole time? [angry] You knew when I messaged you this morning that your roommate was already here. You knew when I was on the train for, what, three hours? [sigh] Oh my God. Okay. Um. Let me just... process this for a second.

# === REMAINING LINES ===

# --- DIALOGUE (continued) ---
17. [gasp softly] Oh man, the pipeline is... well, it's evolving, let's say. We've got maybe thirty percent solid deals, and the rest is, you know, aspirational stuff that could materialize if we, uh, really push the sales team harder.
18. It's not lying, it's... okay, maybe it's creative forecasting, but everyone does it. Like, literally every CRO I know inflates their projections by at least forty percent—it's basically industry standard at this point, I mean, how else do you keep momentum?
19. Yeah yeah, but that's assuming we don't close any of these deals, which, honestly, we probably will close... some of them. Plus there's always bridge funding, or we could, hmm, delay some vendor payments to stretch things out a bit longer.
20. Ha, bankruptcy is just, like, a worst-case scenario that never actually happens if you stay aggressive enough. I've seen companies way worse off than us somehow pull through—it's all about maintaining that growth story until something, er, clicks.
21. Look, you call it magical thinking, but I call it, uh, entrepreneurial optimism or whatever. The minute we start projecting realistic numbers is the minute everyone loses faith, and then we're definitely done—so yeah, we keep pushing these ambitious targets and hope something sticks.
22. [chuckle] Oh I totally get that, believe me. Alright, let me pull up your reservation here... okay so, confirmation number 447829, checking in today for, umm, five nights?
23. Perfect! And I see you've got the ocean view suite, room 2412 on the twenty-fourth floor. The elevators are, uh, just past the lobby bar there on your left.
24. It is actually, yeah! Breakfast runs from 6:30 to 10:30, that's, hmm, in the Coral restaurant downstairs. Your room rate of 389 per night includes that plus access to all three pools.
25. Mmhmm, we've got the main pool on level 3, the adults-only infinity pool on the roof—that's level 31—and then there's the lagoon pool by the beach. All open 7 AM to 11 PM daily.
26. Ooh, so parking's 45 a day for valet or 28 for self-park in structure B. Though honestly, between you and me, most people just Uber everywhere around here anyway, it's usually cheaper.
27. [cough] Sorry, excuse me. Uh, sure, shoot! I mean, I've heard pretty much everything working here for three years, so nothing really surprises me anymore.
28. More than you'd think, actually. Sometimes you just need to be somewhere where nobody knows your name, you know? Your total with taxes comes to 2,247.85, but I get it, I really do.
29. [frustrated] Look, the system's making me ask about our rewards program—you'd save 10% on future stays—but honestly, I'm guessing you just want your key and some peace, right?
30. [passionately] That's what being a strategist taught me before this job, reading people is everything! Your room's ready now, checkout's at 11 AM on the 18th, and the spa has appointments available if you need some real decompression.
31. Six years doing corporate consulting, but this, well, this pays better and I actually get to help people relax instead of stress them out with quarterly projections and efficiency metrics, so here's your key, room 2412.
32. Destroyed is such a gentle word for what I did to him. I prefer "systematically dismantled his entire understanding of the game while watching his soul leave his body."
33. Chess isn't a game—it's psychological warfare with wooden pieces. Every move I make is designed to make my opponent question their entire existence, their intelligence, their worth as a human being.
34. Parents love winners, and I create winners. Their precious children come to me soft and leave sharp enough to cut glass—those who survive the training, anyway.
35. About forty percent drop out in the first month. They cry, they quit, they run back to their participation trophies and safe spaces—which is exactly what I want.
36. Weakness is a disease that spreads. I'd rather have three killers than thirty sheep pretending they have what it takes to dominate.
37. [bitter] I'm here because the federation thinks I need to "give back to the community" after what happened in Prague. Apparently making a grandmaster cry in public is "conduct unbecoming of a professional."
38. Alexei Volkov, sixty-three years old, forty-year career. I had him in checkmate in seventeen moves using a variation he invented—turned his own legacy against him.
39. That's strategy. You find what someone loves most and you use it to destroy them—it's the purest form of victory there is.
40. Your need to be liked, obviously. You're standing here flirting with someone you find morally repugnant because you can't resist the challenge—classic validation-seeking behavior masked as confidence.
41. Pulling punches is for people who are afraid to win. I haven't been afraid of anything since I was seven years old and realized everyone else was playing checkers while I was born for war.
42. Oh yeah? That's great that you're, um, actually considering it. I mean, honestly, getting a mentor was probably the single best decision I made when I was starting out in 3D work.
43. Ahh, pure luck actually. I was posting my terrible renders on this forum, right? And this senior artist just... started leaving these incredibly detailed critiques on everything I made. Eventually we started DMing and, well, here we are five years later.
44. Oh absolutely, we actually grabbed coffee just last week. The relationship definitely evolves though - like, now it's more of a peer thing, you know? But man, those first couple years when I was completely lost, she basically held my hand through every project.
45. [furious] The technical stuff was one thing, but honestly? The biggest help was just having someone tell me when my work was garbage and I needed to start over. Nobody else will give you that kind of brutal honesty, and you need it, even when it, uh, absolutely destroys you at the time.
46. Mmm, it was, but like... necessary intense? I remember spending three weeks on this character model once, thought it was my masterpiece, and she took one look and said "start over, the proportions are fundamentally broken."
47. Yup! And she was completely right. See, that's the thing about good mentors - they're not there to, err, make you feel good about yourself. They're there to make you better, and sometimes that means hearing things that really, really suck to hear.
48. Oh god, constantly. There was this one period where I, hmm, I think I cried after every single feedback session for like a month straight. But then something clicked and suddenly I could see what she'd been trying to show me all along.
49. Right right. Look, I get it, I really do. But here's the thing - the pain isn't the point, it's just, uhh, sometimes a byproduct of pushing past your comfort zone, you know? The good mentors know how to balance the tough love with actual support.
50. [shaky voice] I... yeah, I really do. Because the alternative is spending years making the same mistakes over and over, and that's just... that's so much wasted time. Having someone who's been there guide you through it, even when it's hard, it's invaluable.
51. Honestly? Just be genuine about where you are and what you're looking for. Most artists remember being where you are now, and, I mean, a lot of us actually want to help - we just need to know you're serious about putting in the work, not just looking for shortcuts.
52. Oh hey! Yeah, I'm in 4D, right across the hall actually, and, um, I've been wondering who finally took that unit—it's been empty for like, what, three months? Welcome to the building!
53. Mmm, yeah, moving is always rough at first, but honestly this place grows on you—the neighbors are mostly quiet, except for, uh, 3B who plays saxophone at weird hours, but he's actually pretty good so it's kind of nice?
54. [whispering] Between you and me, he's apparently some semi-famous jazz musician from the eighties, or at least that's what Mrs. Chen told me, and she's been here forever so, I mean, she'd probably know, right?
55. Oh man, where do I even start—there's Derek on the first floor who fixes everyone's bikes for free, and then, hmm, the couple in 2A who run that bakery downtown, they sometimes leave extra pastries by people's doors which is, like, dangerously good for my diet.
56. Right?
57. Oh, I'm Sam! And no worries, I literally did the same thing when I moved in—just started rambling about the building before even saying my name, which is, uh, kind of my thing apparently, just ask anyone.
58. Gosh, it'll be four years this December, which is weird to think about because it doesn't feel that long, but then again, I've basically watched half the building turn over in that time, so, yeah, I guess I'm one of the old-timers now.
59. Honestly? Yeah, I really do—the location is perfect, rent hasn't gone up too crazy, and there's something about having, you know, actual community with your neighbors that's kind of rare these days, especially in the city.
60. [overly polite] Oh, well then you've absolutely made the right choice, and if you need anything at all—seriously, anything—please don't hesitate to knock on my door, I'm usually home evenings and weekends and I'd be more than happy to help however I can.
61. The laundry situation? Yeah, that's, erm, that's a whole thing—you need quarters, specifically, and the change machine is broken half the time, so I usually just grab a roll from the bank once a month and, honestly, I can spot you some until you get sorted.
62. Why not? Three million for six months of consulting work isn't exactly pocket change. Besides, I'm curious what angle he's really playing here—nobody pays that kind of money without expecting something extraordinary in return.
63. Of course I remember. But holding onto old grudges won't bring the company back, will it? Maybe working with him gives me a chance to understand what really happened behind those closed doors.
64. Probably. But here's the thing—I've spent two years watching from the sidelines while he built his empire on our ruins. If there's even a small chance I can learn something useful, something that matters, shouldn't I take it?
65. Then things get interesting. Look, I'm not going in blind here—I've got contingencies, backup plans, the whole nine yards. The question is whether you're going to help me or spend the next hour trying to talk me out of it.
66. [formal] Perhaps he does, perhaps he doesn't. Either way, declining his invitation would suggest I have something to hide, wouldn't it? Better to play the game with confidence than to reveal weakness through hesitation.
67. Good. That means I'm learning. The first rule of defeating your enemy is understanding how they think—and trust me, after studying every deal he's made for the past five years, I'm starting to see the patterns.
68. Absolutely not. He specifically requested me, and sending someone else would be... well, it'd be insulting. Besides, you don't have the technical background to pull off what I'm planning—this needs someone who actually understands the systems.
69. [bored] Sure, if you want to sit in the lobby for six hours reading outdated magazines while I'm in meetings, knock yourself out. Just don't expect him to acknowledge your existence—assistants are basically furniture to people like him.
70. Define dangerous. Because everything worth doing in this industry comes with risks—hostile takeovers, corporate espionage, regulatory investigations. If I walked away from danger, I'd still be teaching freshman economics at a community college.
71. [regretful] Then I'll leave, yes. Though honestly, after everything that's happened, walking away might be the hardest thing I've ever done. Some opportunities only come once, even if they arrive dressed as disasters.
72. No no, please sit. I've been hogging this whole table for an hour just nursing one coffee. The guilt was starting to get to me actually.
73. I saw you doing laps with your laptop bag. Third time past I almost waved you over but thought that might be weird. The lunch rush here is getting absolutely ridiculous lately.
74. Working on this presentation that's due tomorrow. Well, technically I've been staring at slide fourteen for forty minutes trying to make "synergistic optimization" sound less like corporate nonsense. It's not going well.
75. Absolutely nothing, that's the problem. My boss loves these buzzwords though. Last week he wanted me to add "paradigm shift" and "blockchain-adjacent thinking" to a report about office supplies.
76. Right? I spent three hours trying to connect staplers to cryptocurrency. Eventually wrote something about "distributed ledger methodology for inventory tracking" and he loved it. Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads these things.
77. The worst part is I'm getting good at it. Yesterday I described our new coffee machine as having "AI-enhanced beverage curation capabilities." It just has a timer and five buttons.
78. For the quarterly newsletter. Two full paragraphs about its "user-centric interface" and "sustainable consumption metrics." It counts how many cups you've made, that's literally all it does.
79. Melatonin and white noise mostly. Oh, sometimes I read my own presentations—they're more effective than Ambien. Put myself out cold reading about "leveraging cross-functional initiatives" last Tuesday.
80. The soul died somewhere between "thought leadership" and "best-in-class solutions." Now I'm just a hollow vessel that produces PowerPoints. The pay's decent though, and they have good dental.
81. Probably, but quitting requires energy I'm currently spending on making pie charts look revolutionary. Maybe after this presentation I'll update my resume. Or maybe I'll just keep describing printers as having "cutting-edge document manifestation technology."
82. Mmm, yeah, several times actually. It's basically just adding more tasks at the same skill level—horizontal expansion, if you want the textbook definition. Though honestly, most companies get it wrong because they think throwing more work at people somehow equals, uh, employee satisfaction.
83. Sure, I mean, there was this manufacturing plant where we added quality inspection to the assembly workers' responsibilities. Reduced their boredom, I suppose, gave them some variety. The metrics improved by about fifteen percent, which, you know, kept management happy enough.
84. Ehh, it wasn't that revolutionary really. We did phased training over six weeks, added tasks gradually so nobody felt overwhelmed. The trick is making sure the new tasks are actually, like, meaningfully different—not just more of the same drudgery wearing a different hat, if that makes sense.
85. [singing] Oh there's always resistance at first, la la la, people hate change... Ahem, sorry. Yeah, about forty percent pushed back initially, mostly the senior folks who'd been doing things one way for, gosh, decades probably.
86. [empathetically] Well, you have to understand their perspective first, right? These people weren't being difficult just to be difficult—they were genuinely worried about, um, screwing up new responsibilities and looking incompetent after years of being experts at their narrow thing.
87. Ahh, now that's where it gets tricky. Some places did, some didn't. Truthfully, the ones that didn't usually saw the whole initiative fall apart within, I'd say, eighteen months? People aren't stupid—they know when they're doing more work for the same pay.
88. Oh right, yeah, they actually did small bumps—like three to five percent raises, nothing crazy. But see, that's the thing most executives miss: it's not really about the money, it's about, er, acknowledging that you're asking for more. Even symbolic increases can work if the communication is handled properly.
89. Hmm, enrichment's theoretically better since you're adding actual decision-making and autonomy, not just... more stuff to do. But it's harder to implement because, well, managers have to give up control, and good luck with that in most corporate cultures, you know?
90. Once, at a tech startup, but it was kind of a disaster honestly. They tried to do everything at once—more tasks, more responsibility, new reporting structures—and people just got confused about, uh, what their actual job was anymore. Classic case of too much too fast, I guess.
91. Geez, I mean, depends on what problem you're actually trying to solve? If it's just boredom, then maybe start small with enlargement, but if you've got genuine engagement issues then, honestly, you probably need to look at deeper structural problems first. Job design is just, like, rearranging deck chairs if the underlying culture is broken.
92. [apologetic] I am, though I feel strange about leaving. You know, when I started teaching, I thought it was temporary—just until I figured out my "real" career. Then somewhere along the way, those kids became my whole world.
93. There was this student, Marcus, back in '97. Kid couldn't read at grade level, everyone had written him off. We worked together every lunch period for months, and when he finally got through his first whole book—I knew this was where I belonged.
94. Hundreds of them. Marcus is a pediatrician now, can you believe it? Sarah Chen runs a nonprofit. Tommy Rodriguez became a teacher himself—says I inspired him, though honestly he inspires me more.
95. Watching brilliant kids slip through cracks in the system. You can pour everything into them, stay late, buy supplies with your own money, advocate until you're blue in the face—sometimes it's still not enough.
96. Sure. The field trips I didn't fight harder for, the parents I should've called sooner. But mostly I regret how long it took me to realize that teaching isn't about being perfect—it's about showing up, day after day, believing in them when nobody else does.
97. [anxious] The principals changed every few years, each with new initiatives and metrics. Some understood that education is about human connection, but others just saw test scores and budgets—those years were brutal.
98. Every teacher does. Pencils, notebooks, snacks for hungry kids, winter coats sometimes. My classroom library? Built it book by book from garage sales and my own wallet over three decades.
99. Probably tens of thousands, honestly. But when Maria comes in without breakfast and you've got granola bars in your desk drawer, you don't think about the money—you think about her being able to focus on fractions instead of hunger.
100. Remember why you started. The paperwork will drown you, parents will question you, politicians will blame you—but in that classroom, with those kids, you get to change lives. That's the privilege and the burden we carry.
101. Tutoring at the community center, actually. Can't imagine not teaching—it's like asking me not to breathe. These kids deserve someone who sees their potential, and after thirty years, I've gotten pretty good at seeing what others miss.
102. Oh! Actually, I have no idea—this is my first time volunteering here and they kind of just pointed me to this table and said "toys go there," which is, uh, not super helpful when you've got like three thousand toys to organize.
103. [sniffle] Yeah, that was me. My daughter passed away six months ago and, well, these were all hers—figured they should go to kids who'd actually, you know, play with them instead of just sitting in storage making me cry.
104. [joking] It's okay, really—I mean, not okay okay, but I've discovered that sorting tiny plastic dinosaurs is weirdly therapeutic, so there's that. Plus, she would've absolutely roasted me for keeping all this stuff locked up like some kind of toy dragon hoarding treasure.
105. Oh man, she was hilarious—eight years old and already doing standup routines at dinner about how I couldn't tell Pokemon apart. "Dad, that's clearly a Charizard, not a dragon, there's literally fire coming out of its tail," she'd say, like I was personally offending the entire Pokemon universe.
106. [joking] Let me guess—you've been corrected about Batman's origin story at least, what, seventeen times? Because apparently there's the "movie version" and the "real version" and if you mix them up, you've basically committed a crime against humanity?
107. Spreading misinformation! That's amazing. See, this is why I love kids—they're so intensely serious about stuff that, like, objectively doesn't matter, but to them it's everything, and honestly, I kind of miss having someone around to fact-check my Marvel knowledge.
108. [trailing off] That's really sweet, but I should probably... I mean, I'm trying to stay busy these days, keep moving, and after this I've got to...
109. Wait, you... oh. Oh god, I'm an idiot—that's why you're here too, isn't it? The toys, I mean, they're not just random donations for you either, and here I am going on about my stuff without even asking.
110. Jesus. I'm so sorry. And yeah, coffee sounds... coffee sounds good actually. There's this place around the corner that does those fancy drinks with way too much whipped cream that kids love—loved—and sometimes I still order them just because.
111. Exactly! My daughter called it "liquid magic," which, honestly, for twelve dollars it better be. But yeah, let's go spread some misinformation about superheros over overpriced coffee—I think they would've wanted that.
112. Drive to Survive? It's brilliant television but terrible journalism. They manufacture rivalries that don't exist and edit radio messages out of sequence to create drama.
113. No question—Netflix brought millions of new fans. But now drivers complain about fabricated storylines damaging real relationships. Verstappen refused to participate after they made him look like a villain.
114. Access plus narrative restraint. The Last Dance worked because Jordan finally opened up, but also because they structured it like a thriller. Too many docs just string together talking heads and archival footage.
115. That film took five years following those kids. Most documentarians want quick turnarounds, streaming deals. Real intimacy requires time—watching someone's entire life change through basketball.
116. [sad] That footage of his final qualifying lap gets me every time. They built such a complete portrait—the rivalry with Prost, the Brazilian pride, the spiritual searching. It's mythmaking but earned mythmaking.
117. Depends on transparency. The Alpinist used some recreations brilliantly—you knew exactly what was staged versus authentic. But when docs blur those lines without disclosure, they're breaking fundamental trust with viewers.
118. Started as a cycling experiment, ended up fleeing Moscow with hard drives. That pivot from personal journey to international scandal—you can't script that. Bryan Fogel basically stumbled into a geopolitical thriller.
119. [curious] The ethical questions fascinate me more than the climbing. Should filmmakers document something that could kill their subject? They're simultaneously rooting for him and potentially filming his death.
120. When We Were Kings about Ali-Foreman in Zaire. Also, The Two Escobars interweaving Colombian soccer and drug cartels. Both show how sports become proxies for larger cultural tensions.
121. Every league has their own streaming series now, sure. But great stories keep emerging—look at Welcome to Wrexham. The format's elastic enough to handle both billion-dollar franchises and amateur cricket clubs.
122. That's the paradox of modern minimalism right there. We accumulate things trying to optimize our lives, then realize the optimization itself became clutter. The irony is almost poetic.
123. Classic case of solution shopping. Each bottle probably solved a specific problem—one for hot drinks, one for the gym, one that fits in your car holder. Before you know it, you've got a cabinet full of solutions to problems you barely have.
124. No, but I've had the exact same conversation with myself about kitchen gadgets. Turns out I don't actually need three different types of garlic presses. Who knew one would suffice?
125. You just captured consumer culture in a jingle. The thing is, minimalism itself became something to consume—books about owning less, organizers for your fewer things, apps to track your decluttering. It's wild.
126. That's the pendulum swing too far the other way. Real minimalism isn't about deprivation, it's about intention. If sitting on the floor doesn't serve her life, she's just practicing performative simplicity.
127. [empathetically] That's completely valid though. Objects hold memories, provide comfort, create atmosphere. The goal isn't emptiness—it's knowing why each thing is there and whether it still serves that purpose.
128. Freedom from the maintenance. Every object you own requires some amount of your attention—cleaning it, organizing it, remembering where it is. Minimalism just means being selective about what gets your mental energy.
129. Perfect example. Three hours of your finite life devoted to shuffling random batteries and mystery keys. Imagine if that drawer just didn't exist—those three hours become yours again.
130. [empathetically] Everyone does, and we keep them because throwing away a key feels like tempting fate. What if it opens something important? But really, when have you ever needed one of those orphan keys?
131. [shaky voice] That's the fantasy, isn't it? Complete reset, blank slate, new beginning. But life doesn't actually work that way—we're always carrying something forward, whether it's physical or not.
132. Oh god, yeah, that's mine. I, uh, really thought the metaphor about emotional drought would land better, but honestly people just keep asking why I gave the cactus a Brooklyn accent.
133. That's film festival speak for "what the hell were you thinking," right? Look, I get it, the whole thing is basically absurd, but mmm, sometimes you just gotta follow your weird creative impulses and see where they take you.
134. Fifty-two thousand, actually. My dad keeps texting me stock market articles with, like, really passive-aggressive subject lines about "smart investments" and I'm just pretending my phone is broken.
135. [bitter] Oh fantastic, that's the third one. You know what though? Their loss, because the cactus delivers a genuinely moving monologue about water conservation in act two that, uhh, absolutely nobody will stick around to see apparently.
136. [relieved] Thank god! That means she won't see the interpretive dance number. I was really second-guessing that choice, especially since, well, cacti don't traditionally have limbs so the choreography got a bit abstract.
137. More of a rhythmic swaying situation, honestly. The motion capture suit we put on the succulent was, erm, probably overkill, but the guy at the effects house gave us a discount so we kind of went for it.
138. Bread? Like, just regular bread? Actually no, you know what, after my whole cactus disaster I have zero room to judge anyone's artistic choices, so yeah, tell me about your carbohydrate cinema.
139. Jeez, okay, inside voices maybe? But actually that sounds legitimately interesting. Like, there's probably some real cultural commentary there about, uhh, industrialization and the loss of craftsmanship or whatever, which beats my desert plant having an existential crisis.
140. [speeding up] Look people liked that movie about the tire that killed people and that was literally just a homicidal piece of rubber rolling around so honestly anything's possible and bread is way more relatable than murder wheels so you're probably fine!
141. [chuckle] Yeah well, silence is, erm, technically a form of feedback too. Next year I'm thinking maybe something with a talking mushroom instead, really lean into the whole "things that shouldn't talk but do" genre I've apparently created.
142. You're absolutely right. I missed that completely. The indemnification terms would leave us exposed to significant financial risk if we don't address those loopholes before signing.
143. I'll get that over immediately. Your eye for detail just saved us from a potential disaster. How did you even catch that buried in all the subsidiary clauses?
144. Fifteen years? I had no idea you'd been practicing that long. You look way too young to have that kind of experience under your belt.
145. Right, the timeline. We're looking at a Q3 completion if everything goes smoothly, but given the regulatory hurdles we're facing, Q4 seems more realistic don't you think?
146. You've already made contact? That's impressive. Most firms wait weeks before even attempting to reach out. What kind of response did you get from them?
147. Of course you did. You always seem to be three steps ahead of everyone else in the room. Do you have those market share reports ready to go?
148. [long pause] You submitted them yesterday? Without running them by the team first? That's incredibly bold, even for someone with your track record.
149. You're right, waiting would have been inefficient. I just wish you'd looped me in. Communication is still important even when you're certain about the path forward.
150. I appreciate that. Your expertise is invaluable but we function better as a team when everyone's informed. Speaking of which, have you reviewed the intellectual property transfers yet?
151. Two patents? Those could have derailed everything months down the line. Your thoroughness just keeps saving this deal. I honestly don't know how we functioned before you joined.
152. [trailing off] It's the study of language using massive collections of real texts. We analyze millions of words to see patterns in how people actually speak and write, not just how grammar books say they should...
153. Pretty much! We use computer programs to search through everything from newspaper articles to Twitter posts. The British National Corpus alone has over 100 million words of text.
154. [short pause] Everything gets tagged and categorized. Each word gets labeled with its part of speech, then we can search for patterns like how often "absolutely" appears before adjectives versus verbs.
155. [crying while speaking] That's exactly why we need corpora! They capture language at specific moments in time. We can actually track how words like "literally" changed meaning by comparing corpora from different decades.
156. The word "nice" used to mean stupid or foolish in Middle English. Corpus analysis shows it completely flipped meaning over about 300 years—talk about semantic shift.
157. Exactly! And get this—the phrase "the proof is in the pudding" is actually wrong. The original was "the proof of the pudding is in the eating," but the shortened version took over completely.
158. [singing] The Google Books corpus has over 500 billion words! Though the Common Crawl corpus of web pages is even bigger—we're talking petabytes of text data.
159. Not predict exactly, but we can spot trends early. Like seeing "because" becoming a preposition—"because reasons"—started in internet speak and now it's spreading to spoken English.
160. Absolutely. The Corpus of Contemporary American English tracks US usage while the British National Corpus covers UK English. The differences in frequency patterns are fascinating.
161. [very loudly] AntConc is popular for beginners, but serious researchers use tools like Sketch Engine or CQPweb! They can process billions of words in seconds and generate concordances instantly!
162. The xenophyophores? Yeah, finding single-celled organisms that large at Challenger Deep is remarkable. They're basically giant amoebas living under pressure that would crush most life forms.
163. The Pacific Ocean alone has dozens of unexplored trenches. The Kermadec Trench, the Philippine Trench, the Japan Trench—we've barely scratched the surface of what's living in these hadal zones.
164. Actually, most hadal zone creatures don't bioluminesce. The amphipods and snailfish down there evolved without it since there's literally no light to compete with or respond to.
165. [quickly] Right, Hexactinellida off British Columbia. Those reefs were thought extinct for 40 million years until we found living ones. They're basically living fossils made of silicon dioxide.
166. Somniosus microcephalus—the vertebrate with the longest known lifespan. Some individuals are over 400 years old, swimming around since before the American Revolution.
167. They're mostly blind actually. Parasitic copepods attach to their corneas. But they navigate using electroreception and their lateral line system to detect movement in the water.
168. Thriving might be generous. Their metabolism is so slow they move at about one kilometer per hour. They're basically underwater zombies that occasionally eat a seal.
169. True, they handle temperatures near freezing. Their tissues contain trimethylamine oxide and urea that work like antifreeze. Same compounds that make their meat toxic to humans actually.
170. Stomatopods have sixteen types of color receptors compared to our three. They can see ultraviolet, visible light, circular polarized light, even linear polarized light. Most complex eyes in the animal kingdom.
171. Well, the Great Barrier Reef would, if it wasn't mostly bleached. We've lost about half the coral coverage since the 1990s. Acropora species are particularly vulnerable to temperature changes.
172. Yeah, that's, um, what they call me here. Welcome to the Interactive Physics Experience where you can, uh, manipulate electromagnetic fields with your hands and basically see invisible forces come to life.
173. [monotone] Mmm, ironic, right? I used to be really enthusiastic about the electric displays, but after two thousand demonstrations, well, the spark kind of dies, you know? Anyway, should we start with the plasma globe or the Van de Graaff generator?
174. Oh, completely safe, yeah. The glass contains the ionized gas and, um, when you touch it, you're actually completing a circuit that draws the plasma filaments toward your hand—it's basically like becoming a human lightning rod but, you know, harmless.
175. [shaky voice] Ah, so the purple comes from... from the specific noble gases inside, usually neon and argon, which emit that color when, uh, when electrically excited. Sometimes I still get a little nervous around the really bright discharges even though I know they're contained.
176. Hmm, three years now, every single day except holidays. That's roughly, let's see... six thousand hours of explaining why magnets repel and attract, which honestly starts to feel like you're living in some kind of educational purgatory after a while.
177. Oof, well, the kids' faces when they make their hair stand up with static electricity—that's, um, that's still pretty good. Though mostly I just think about quantum mechanics while I'm talking, like how weird it is that we're all just probability waves pretending to be solid, you know?
178. Yeah, so when you repeat the same facts eight times a day, your mind kind of wanders into deeper territory. Like, I'll be explaining magnetism while simultaneously wondering if free will exists or if we're all just, uh, following predetermined electromagnetic pathways through spacetime.
179. Mmm, probably not. Most visitors are here for twenty minutes max, they get their Instagram photos with the Tesla coil and move on. You're actually the first person in weeks to, um, ask me anything beyond "where's the bathroom?"
180. Honestly? The ferrofluid display in the corner that nobody notices. It's this magnetic liquid that forms these incredible spike patterns, like alien geometry, and it basically shows how, uh, hidden forces shape everything around us even when we can't see them.
181. [very quickly] Sure yeah let's go it's actually my favorite because it's quiet and mesmerizing and people usually skip it so I can just stand there and watch it move without having to explain anything and sometimes I pretend it's alive and trying to communicate through its patterns which I know sounds weird but after this many hours here your brain starts making up stories to stay sane.
182. The particulate matter from the highway is definitely taking its toll on them. They're developing these brown spots on their petals that weren't there last season. The curator mentioned they might need to install better filtration systems.
183. [delighted] They are resilient to certain things! But urban pollutants are a completely different beast than what they'd face in their natural habitats. In the wild, they deal with humidity changes and competition for light, not diesel exhaust and industrial chemicals.
184. Those are struggling too, actually. The acid rain we've been getting has been changing the pH of the water feature. The fronds are starting to yellow at the tips, which is classic nutrient lockout from pH imbalance.
185. They're trying, but it's like fighting a losing battle when new contaminated rainwater keeps entering the system. Every storm basically undoes a week of careful pH balancing. The maintenance team is considering a complete overhaul of the water recycling system.
186. Incredibly expensive. We're talking about a quarter million dollars just for the new filtration equipment. And that doesn't even address the root cause of the pollution that's drifting in from the industrial district.
187. [frustrated] That's because they've basically created an artificial bubble over there with specialized air purifiers running twenty-four seven. It costs a fortune in electricity, and honestly, it feels like we're just treating symptoms instead of the actual disease.
188. True, the bamboo grove and the koi pond are thriving under that protection. But it makes you wonder what we're losing in the unprotected areas. Some of the native wildflower meadows are down to half their original species diversity.
189. [jealous] The purple coneflowers disappeared completely last year, while somehow the invasive bindweed is absolutely flourishing in the polluted soil. It's infuriating how the plants we don't want seem to thrive on contamination while the beautiful natives just wither away.
190. There's actually a research team doing exactly that right now. They're trying to understand what makes certain plants pollution-resistant. Could lead to some interesting bioengineering possibilities for urban green spaces.
191. I know what you mean. The old photographs in the visitor center show what this place looked like thirty years ago. The difference is heartbreaking, but at least we're still fighting to preserve what we can.
192. Oh god, um, where did you hear that? That's not—okay, it wasn't a handshake exactly, the calibration was just, uh, slightly off during the demonstration. Nobody was actually in danger or anything like that.
193. Honestly? It's been... phew, it's been a journey. We've got this $2.3 million da Vinci system that's incredible when it works, but the learning curve is, I mean, steeper than we anticipated.
194. Well, truthfully, it's not the tech itself—it's getting our senior surgeons on board. Dr. Harrison literally said he'd rather retire than "let a robot do his job," which is, err, not really how it works at all.
195. Ah, you know, it's understandable really. These doctors have been perfecting their craft for decades, and now we're asking them to basically relearn everything through a console with, um, these little joysticks. It's a huge adjustment.
196. [whispering] Between you and me, we've actually completed seventeen successful procedures already. The precision is, honestly, it's mind-blowing—we're talking tremor reduction down to 0.2 millimeters, which is essentially superhuman accuracy.
197. Ha! Yeah, of course. We do tours every Thursday actually. Just, uh, don't mention the handshake thing to anyone else—our PR team is still, hmm, recovering from that particular incident.
198. [overly polite] Oh, we've got this fascinating new AI diagnostic system that can detect early-stage cancers with 94% accuracy. It's analyzing thousands of scans in seconds, which would normally take our radiologists, gosh, hours and hours to review manually.
199. Right? And, um, here's the wild part—it keeps learning. Every scan makes it smarter, so that 94% is climbing. We're projecting 97% accuracy by next quarter, which is, I mean, better than most human specialists.
200. Mmm, some are, yeah. But we're trying to frame it as, like, augmentation not replacement. The AI catches things, the humans verify and make the final calls—it's basically giving them superhuman vision, not, uh, taking their jobs away.
201. Hah, essentially! Though if we could actually build cyborg doctors, maybe they'd be less resistant to using the surgical robots. Win-win, right?
202. Picture this: Lehman Brothers, a 158-year-old institution, vaporizes overnight. Trillions in wealth disappears. Banks stop lending to each other because nobody knows who's holding toxic assets. The entire global economy teeters on the edge of complete collapse.
203. They slapped a band-aid on a severed artery. Dodd-Frank created some rules, sure, but the biggest banks are now thirty percent larger than before the crisis. They're not too big to fail anymore—they're too big to even comprehend.
204. [excited] The derivatives market is where it gets truly insane! We're talking 600 trillion dollars in notional value—that's seven times the entire global GDP! These instruments are so complex that the people trading them often don't fully understand the risks they're taking.
205. Because the people writing the laws take millions in campaign contributions from the banks they're supposed to regulate. Jamie Dimon has senators on speed dial. Goldman Sachs alumni run half the Treasury departments worldwide.
206. [long pause] The Federal Reserve printed four trillion dollars out of thin air during quantitative easing. They bought mortgage-backed securities—the same toxic garbage that caused the crisis—to prop up bank balance sheets. They essentially rewarded failure with free money.
207. [laugh] Sustainable? We're living in the largest asset bubble in human history. Stock markets hit records while real wages stagnate. Houses cost ten times median income. The everything bubble will pop, and when it does, 2008 will look like a practice run.
208. Dark? This is reality. Central banks have negative interest rates—they're literally paying people to borrow money. We've broken capitalism itself. The rules that governed economics for centuries no longer apply.
209. FDIC insurance covers 250,000 per account, which sounds nice until you realize the FDIC has about 100 billion in reserves to cover 9 trillion in insured deposits. If multiple major banks fail simultaneously, that insurance is worthless paper.
210. First, credit freezes completely. ATMs stop working. Supply chains break because companies can't finance shipments. Grocery stores empty within 72 hours. Then governments implement capital controls, bail-ins where they confiscate deposits, maybe even monetary resets.
211. People always prefer comfortable lies to uncomfortable truths. But mathematics doesn't care about your feelings. Exponential debt growth versus linear GDP growth equals inevitable collapse. The only question is when, not if.
# --- SIMPLE_TAGS (continued) ---
212. [hesitantly] The demon lord's essence... [gasps] It still pulses beneath the ruins.
213. [very quietly] Not alive, but not truly dead either—like me. [pause] It feeds on the sorrow here, growing stronger each night when my banshee wail pierces the darkness.
214. [softly] You would still fight beside me? [trembling] Even like this?
215. [relieved] Maybe that's why I couldn't move on—waiting for you to return, to forgive me for not being strong enough to save everyone AND survive.
216. [forgiving] There's nothing to forgive, Marcus. [warmly] We both did what we thought was right, and now we have a chance to truly end this nightmare together.
217. [hesitantly] Look, I supported the development because the economic projections showed it would bring hundreds of jobs to the area and increase property values for everyone who—
218. [formal] The city offered fair market value compensation, and there were relocation assistance programs available to help families transition to new housing situations. [clears throat]
219. [frustrated] The area was deteriorating, the infrastructure was failing, and without development, the whole neighborhood would have continued to decline indefinitely.
220. [condescending] Those are nice sentiments, but nostalgia doesn't fix broken sewage systems or bring sustainable employment to struggling communities. [sighs]
221. [hesitantly] I understand this is emotional for you, but progress requires difficult decisions, and the greater good sometimes means individual sacrifices have to be made.
222. [quietly] I drive past it on my commute every day actually, and the parking lot is always full, the stores are thriving, people are working there. [pause]
223. [confused] Your daughter works at the complex? But I thought you were against—
224. [apologetic] I didn't realize the personal impact was so—I mean, the reports and projections don't really capture these individual stories, do they?
225. [regretful] Maybe I should have visited the neighborhood before speaking at those meetings, actually met the families instead of just reviewing development proposals. [long pause]
226. [very sincerely] Would you be willing to help me understand what questions I should be asking, what the reports don't show? [pause] I want to do better.
227. [curious] Of course, Mr. Chen, though I have to say this feels unusually formal for our typical conversations about Sophia's training schedule. [pause] Is everything alright with her shoulder injury from regionals?
228. [confused] Wait, I'm sorry, transitioning away? [quietly] She just qualified for Junior Nationals and we've been discussing NCAA recruitment strategies for months now—Stanford's scout was literally here last week watching her.
229. [frustrated] A hobby? [exhales] Mr. Chen, your daughter has Olympic trial potential—she's dropping two seconds off her butterfly every season, and you're calling four-hour daily training sessions for six years a hobby?
230. Have you, um, actually discussed this with Sophia? Because yesterday she was asking me about altitude training camps for next summer and talking about breaking the state record—she didn't mention Singapore or internships at all.
231. [bitter] You know what's interesting? [sighs] In six years, I've seen you at exactly three meets, but somehow you're an expert on what this sport means to your daughter and what she's capable of achieving.
232. [passionately] Generational wealth? Your daughter cried for twenty minutes in my office after winning States because you didn't even text congratulations. [quietly] She doesn't want your money, Mr. Chen, she wants you to see who she actually is.
233. [shaky voice] Fantasies? She's ranked third nationally in her age group! [exhales] But you're right about one thing—I'm just her coach, though apparently I know her dreams better than her own father does.
234. [sad] No, but they're the reason she gets up at four-thirty every morning, even Sundays, even her birthday. [very quietly] They're the reason she keeps pushing through injuries and setbacks that would break most adults I know.
235. [resigned] Fine, but, um, can I at least ask one thing? [pleading] Let her tell me herself—don't make her just disappear from the pool one day without saying goodbye to her teammates and, honestly, to me.
236. [very quietly] You know what the saddest part is, Mr. Chen? [pause] Sophia could've had both—the boardroom and the pool—but you've decided she has to choose, and worse, you've chosen for her.
237. [formal] Good morning, Ms. Rodriguez. [pause] I've reviewed your case file regarding the noise violations from unit 4B, and I see there have been six complaints filed over the past three weeks. Can you help me understand the situation from your perspective?
238. [analytically] The complaints indicate noise disturbances primarily between eleven PM and four AM, with decibel readings reaching eighty-five according to one tenant's measurement app. [clearing throat] That's comparable to city traffic levels, which does exceed residential quiet hours standards.
239. Ms. Rodriguez, I need you to understand this isn't a punitive hearing. [warmly] We're trying to find a solution that works for everyone, including you and your daughter.
240. [thoughtfully] Have you explored medical interventions for the colic beyond what you've mentioned? [pause] Sometimes underlying conditions like reflux or allergies can exacerbate crying episodes, and addressing those can significantly reduce the duration and intensity.
241. [empathetically] I can see you're doing everything possible to address this situation. [formally] Let me review the building's covenant regarding infant-related noise—there are actually specific provisions that differ from standard noise violations.
242. [confidently] Under fair housing regulations, families with children cannot be discriminated against, and normal child-related noise is generally protected. [pause] However, we need to establish that you're taking reasonable measures to minimize the disturbance, which it clearly sounds like you are.
243. [impressed] This level of documentation actually works strongly in your favor, Ms. Rodriguez. [analytically] It demonstrates due diligence and good faith efforts to resolve the issue, which is exactly what we look for in these cases.
244. [gently] Based on everything you've presented, I'm prepared to dismiss these violations with prejudice, meaning they cannot be refiled. [pause] Additionally, I'm going to issue a formal finding that any future complaints must account for the temporary nature of infant colic and your documented mitigation efforts.
245. [warmly] Ms. Rodriguez, the system isn't always as heartless as it seems. [chuckle] I'm also going to recommend the building provide you with resources for soundproofing assistance, which they're required to consider as a reasonable accommodation.
246. [reassuringly] Keep that notebook going, and if anyone gives you trouble, you have my direct number on this ruling document. [formally] This hearing is concluded, and Ms. Rodriguez, it does get better—both the colic and the sleeping, I promise you that from personal experience.
247. [shaky voice] Sam? What the hell are you doing here? [coughs] Look, I don't have time for whatever this is—the support beam shifted about twenty minutes ago and I've got maybe an hour before this whole section comes down.
248. [bitter] Of course you'd show up now, after eight years of silence, when I'm literally buried alive. [exhales] You always did have perfect timing for making everything about you, didn't you?
249. [frustrated] There's an old ventilation shaft about fifteen feet to my left, but it's partially blocked with debris. [groans] If you could somehow clear it from your end, I might, um, I might be able to squeeze through before everything collapses.
250. [quietly] The middle one, with the yellow hazard paint that's mostly peeled off. [sighs] And yeah, well, Mom needed you there, not me—she made that pretty clear when she didn't even tell me you weren't coming.
251. Right, your career—always the priority. [coughs] Look, just, can you focus on the shaft? I can hear the rock shifting down here and it's, uh, it's getting worse.
252. [very quietly] Sam, don't do this now. [pause] Just get the crowbar and get me out of here, and then we can have whatever conversation you've been rehearsing in your head for the last eight years.
253. [angrily] I'm nothing like him! [exhales] I became an engineer to make these places safe, to prevent what happened to him from happening to anyone else, but you wouldn't know that because you never asked, never called, never—[loud crash]
254. [coughing] The beam just dropped another foot—Sam, you need to hurry. [shaky voice] And for what it's worth, I, uh, I listened to every audiobook you narrated, even the terrible romance novels, just to hear your voice again.
255. [very quietly] Get the crowbar, Sam. [firmly] We'll have time for apologies when I'm not about to be crushed—but yeah, I missed you too, you melodramatic idiot, every single day.
256. [relieved] I can see light coming through—you got it open! [quickly] Okay, I'm going to try to climb up but the walls are unstable so if you hear anything collapse, just, um, just get clear and don't look back, promise me.
257. [apologetic] I understand you're upset, and you have every right to be. We thought we had clearance from the county for this location. [pause] I'm just here to grab our color calibration monitors and the backup drives we left yesterday.
258. [calmly] Look, there's clearly been a miscommunication somewhere. [sighs] I'm not the producer or director, I just manage the digital footage and make sure the colors look right on screen.
259. [hesitantly] Fair enough. [quietly] But while I'm packing up, can I ask why you chose such complete isolation? Most people at least keep a mailbox at the main road.
260. [empathetically] Actually, I might understand more than you think. [slowly] I spend twelve hours a day staring at screens in a dark tent, avoiding the crew's small talk because it breaks my concentration.
261. [very quietly] I haven't been home in three months. [sighs] I sleep in the equipment truck between locations because facing an empty apartment feels harder than just staying with the machines.
262. [bitter] Being surrounded by people who only see you as a function, not a person, is the worst kind of isolation. [clearing throat] At least you chose your solitude; mine just happened while I was looking at color graphs.
263. [relieved] Thank you, I'll clean all of it up, not just our stuff. [pause] And I'll make sure the production company knows this was private property, though I doubt they'll care much.
264. [chuckle] If you want, I could adjust your camera settings for better night visibility. [quickly] It would only take a few minutes, and then I'll be gone.
265. [warm] Because I understand wanting to protect your space from intrusion. [very sincerely] And because maybe helping one person who actually chose isolation properly makes up for all of us who just stumbled into it accidentally.
266. [confidently] Deal. And honestly, after I submit my resignation tonight, I won't be anyone from their production anymore anyway. [exhales] Maybe it's time I chose my isolation instead of letting it choose me.
267. [firmly] Listen to me very carefully, I need you to stay calm right now. [quickly] Is she having contractions? How far apart are they coming?
268. [stern] Forget the tire, focus on her breathing. [demanding] Get her into the backseat right now, recline it as far as possible, and grab any clean towels or blankets you have.
269. [very quickly] Do NOT let her push yet! [firmly] Put the phone on speaker and place it where you can hear me. Check if the cord is around the baby's neck.
270. [confidently] You're doing great, both of you. [passionately] On the next contraction, she can push, but controlled pushing only, like she's blowing out birthday candles slowly. Support the baby's head with your palm.
271. [warmly] Perfect, that's perfect! [quickly] Once the shoulders are out, the baby will come fast. Be ready to catch, don't pull, just guide and support. [pause] You've got this.
272. [calmly] Rub her back firmly with the towel, stimulate her. [speaking fast] Clear any mucus from her nose and mouth with your finger. Is she responding to the rubbing?
273. [very excited] Beautiful! That's exactly what we want to hear! [warmly] Now wrap her in whatever clean fabric you have and place her skin-to-skin on mom's chest. Keep them both warm.
274. [cheerfully] You did incredibly well for someone who works with rubber and steel. [chuckles] Most first-time birth partners don't handle it half as well, even in a hospital.
275. [reassuringly] Some bleeding is normal after delivery, but keep pressure on any active bleeding with clean towels. [firmly] Tell the paramedics she delivered about five minutes ago. They'll take over from here.
276. [sincerely] You rose to the moment when it mattered. [warmly] I'll meet you all at the hospital to check on mom and baby. Tell her she did amazingly, and so did her emergency midwife.
277. [very quietly] You finally came back, Malphas. [slowly] I've been counting the sunrises through these broken windows for three hundred and forty-seven years, waiting for the one who bound me here.
278. [warmly] The curse caught me when I tried to follow you through the portal that night. [pause] My body died but my soul couldn't leave, tethered to this place by your own magic, watching seasons turn to decades, decades to centuries.
279. [empathetically] How could you have known? [slowly] You were fighting a war against heaven itself, and I was just a human who loved a demon, foolish enough to think I could help somehow.
280. [drifting] Alone isn't quite accurate anymore. [chuckles] After the first century, you learn to find company in dust motes dancing in sunbeams, in the mice that nest in the walls, in memories that replay like broken music boxes.
281. [hesitantly] After waiting this long, the thought of leaving terrifies me more than staying. [sighs] What if there's nothing beyond this? What if I dissolve into nothing the moment your magic releases its hold?
282. [lovingly] You gave me eternity to perfect my love for you, even if you never meant to. [laughs] Every ghost story needs a tragic romance, and ours spans centuries now, written in cobwebs and moonlight through broken glass.
283. [peacefully] Hatred requires energy I learned to stop wasting around year fifty. [slowly] Now there's only this strange, translucent love that passes through me like light through water, neither warming nor cooling, just existing.
284. You would bind yourself here? [gasps softly] After everything you fought to escape, all the freedom you won in your rebellion, you'd surrender it for a ghost who barely remembers how to be human?
285. [whispering] Then stay, but know that loving a specter means loving echoes and shadows. [sighs] I can't touch you, can't warm you, can't be anything more than a voice in the darkness and a shimmer in the light.
286. [delighted] Then welcome home, my dark angel. [slowly] Let me show you how I've mapped every crack in the ceiling, named every spider in the corners, and learned to dance with the drafts that whistle through these halls.
287. [apologetic] The creditors insisted I start immediately, and I didn't realize the health department had already scheduled their quarterly review for today. [sighs] Look, we're both just doing our jobs here, trying to help in different ways.
288. [warmly] That's not what I do at all—I'm trying to find a way to keep them operational while satisfying the creditors. [pause] Sometimes restructuring means finding creative solutions that nobody else can see.
289. [concerned] Five degrees too warm? [quickly] That's exactly the kind of thing that could tank any restructuring plan if it leads to a shutdown order from your department.
290. [anxious] Wait, you mean you're shutting them down today? [very quietly] Mrs. Nguyen said she had another week to get the repair company out here, that you'd given her an extension last time.
291. [passionately] What if I can get a repair crew here within the hour? [speeding up] I have emergency contractors on speed dial for exactly these situations—it's part of what I do, fixing critical issues fast.
292. [confidently] My team handles restaurant restructuring all over the city, and I've got relationships with every major equipment supplier and repair service. [pause] Give me one hour to prove this place is worth saving.
293. [soothing] Then let's tackle them one by one, starting with the most critical. [warmly] You clearly care about this place as much as the family does, or you wouldn't have given them so many chances already.
294. [gently] What if we work together on this? [excited] You tell me exactly what needs to be fixed to pass inspection, I'll mobilize my resources to get it done, and we both help save forty-two jobs in this neighborhood.
295. [passionate] That's what's at stake here—not just a family business but an entire ecosystem of employment and community connection. [firmly] I've restructured plenty of chains that nobody would miss, but this place actually matters.
296. [relieved] Thank you, seriously, this means everything. [quickly] I'm calling them right now, and while we wait, maybe you can walk me through those other violations so I can start planning how to address them all. [chuckles] Who knows, we might actually make a good team.
297. [quietly] The insurance check finally cleared last week, all hundred and forty thousand dollars of what used to be my life. [bitter] They said I should treat myself to something nice with part of it, as if a vacation could somehow replace thirty years of memories.
298. [shaky voice] My daughter keeps pushing me to go to Iceland because we had all these travel books about it that she saved from when she was little. [pause] They're gone now too, obviously, but she printed out pages from the internet and made me a new book.
299. [defensive] Solo, definitely solo, because I can't handle being responsible for someone else's happiness right now when I can barely manage my own. [sighs] Is that pathetic, running away to another country because I can't stand looking at the empty lot where my house used to be?
300. How long should I go for?
301. The thing is, I keep thinking about booking it but then freezing up because what if something happens while I'm gone? [anxiously] What if there's another emergency and I'm thousands of miles away on some glacier, completely unreachable?
302. [frustrated] God, more insurance, because the last policy worked out so well for me, right? [sighs] Sorry, that's not fair to you, I know you're just trying to help and I'm being difficult about everything.
303. My therapist says I need to stop living in this suspended state where I'm neither moving forward nor properly grieving. [quietly] She thinks the trip might help me figure out who I am now that everything that defined me is literally ash.
304. [trembling] The fire started in my study where I kept all our family photos, forty years of Christmas mornings and birthday parties and first days of school. [crying while speaking] I used to spend hours planning imaginary trips from those old National Geographic magazines, and now I have all this money to actually go, but no photos to remember why I wanted to.
305. Book it.
306. [exhausted] I'm so tired of being the woman whose house burned down, the tragedy everyone whispers about at the grocery store. [firmly] Maybe in Iceland I can just be another tourist taking too many photos of sheep and waterfalls, building a new collection of memories that nobody can burn.
# --- CUSTOMER_SUPPORT (continued) ---
307. Oh, I hear you, I really do. This is affecting your immediate needs. Let me... okay, I'm looking at what else we can do here. You've been a customer since 2019, perfect payment history...
308. Absolutely.
309. I'm already working on it. I'm issuing a provisional credit for $500 to your account, authorization code AUTH-8MK2-PP91, which will post within the next two hours. The full $2,127.43 will be restored once we complete the dispute investigation, but this gets you immediate access to funds...
310. Listen, I've been doing this for eight years and these automated holds are... they're the worst part of electronic banking. Nobody should have to deal with their money just disappearing. The provisional credit will show as pending in about fifteen minutes, fully available by 2 PM today...
311. So the full dispute resolution for case DSP-7QR9-CC42 typically completes within 48 hours for merchant errors like this. But between you and me? PG&E usually releases these failed authorizations by tomorrow morning. Either way, your money's coming back. I promise you that.
312. Thank you for reaching out. Let me pull up order #87329 in our system right away to check the current status and see what options we have available for you.
313. I can see your order entered our fulfillment process at 6:47 AM this morning and is currently in the packaging phase at our distribution center in facility DC-4.
314. I understand your situation completely. While I cannot stop an order that's already in our packaging queue, I can arrange for you to refuse delivery or initiate a prepaid return with immediate refund processing upon receipt.
315. Absolutely.
316. If you refuse delivery, the package will automatically return to us and we'll process your refund of $284.50 within 24 hours of receiving it back, typically 5-7 business days total.
317. With our prepaid return option, you'd receive the package tomorrow as scheduled, and I can email you a return label immediately with tracking number RTN-55847-B for priority processing.
318. Yes, actually. With the prepaid priority return, once you drop it at any shipping location, we'll issue your refund within 2 business days of the tracking showing it's in transit.
319. Perfect. I'm generating your priority return label now, and you'll receive it at your email address on file within the next 5 minutes along with detailed instructions.
320. Of course.
321. You're very welcome. I've also added a note to your account #2847563 indicating this was a priority cancellation request, and our returns team will expedite processing when they receive package RTN-55847-B back from you.
322. Oh absolutely absolutely I hear you and I'm pulling up your account right now just need your phone number ending in the last four digits so I can see what happened with that previous call and honestly we're gonna get this sorted right away no question about it
323. *sharp inhale* Okay wow yeah I can see here in the system log CALL-ID-48392-B that you were with Marcus for seventeen minutes before the disconnect and that should NOT have happened I mean this is exactly the kind of thing where I'm already escalating internally while we're talking because that's just not acceptable
324. Right right absolutely not
325. *exhale* So here's what I'm doing instead because waiting is the last thing you need right now I've got override authority up to level L4-COMP which means I can handle probably ninety percent of what a manager would do anyway and I'm already seeing your case history here REF-20241108-KP and this is definitely something we need to fix immediately
326. And you're going to get it I mean look at this your original request RMA-7764-X from November 3rd should've been processed already this is sitting here in pending status for absolutely no good reason and that's weird actually let me dig into why that got stuck
327. No no no this matters this is exactly why I'm pushing this through right now not making you wait another second because I can see the refund amount is $847.92 and that's not trivial money that's real money that affects real life and honestly the fact that our system dropped your call earlier makes this even more urgent
328. That's exactly what I'm doing
329. *sharp inhale* Already processing literally as we speak I've initiated instant transfer protocol ITP-RUSH-2847 which bypasses the standard three to five day wait and you should see this hit your account within two to four hours maximum and I'm also adding a courtesy credit code DELAY50 for the inconvenience because three hours of your time is unacceptable
330. Yeah well Marcus was wrong and I'm looking at his notes here from ticket TKT-98341-M and respectfully he missed about four different ways to resolve this so what I'm doing is documenting everything in your file with priority flag PF-EXECUTIVE so if anything goes sideways which it won't but if it does any agent who pulls this up will see exactly what needs to happen
331. Absolutely yes your confirmation is CNF-44789-PRIORITY and I'm emailing it right now plus texting it to your phone ending in 7793 and honestly if you don't see that money by let's say 6 PM today I want you calling back asking for me specifically I'm Jordan employee ID JRD-4429 and we will absolutely escalate this further but I really don't think that's gonna be necessary because it's processing right now
332. Oh! Absolutely. Let me... pull up your account here. I think I can definitely help you find something better. Account number ending in 4782, right? Premium tier at $89.99 monthly?
333. Got it got it! So here's what I'm seeing. We've got three options below your current tier. Standard at $49.99. Basic at $29.99. And then there's... kind of a hidden gem? Legacy Lite at $19.99 that I can probably still activate with code LGC-2024-V3.
334. Right right! The Legacy Lite. It's sort of... not advertised anymore? But I can see it's still in our system. Compatible with your account type A-7. You'd keep about 70% of your current features.
335. Okay so. Let me break this down. You'd keep streaming up to 1080p resolution. Storage stays at 100GB. The things you'd lose... mainly the priority support channel. Download speeds cap at 25 Mbps instead of unlimited. And the family sharing drops from 6 profiles to just 2.
336. Ah!
337. The Standard! Yes yes. So that one... I think that might be perfect actually? $49.99 keeps all 6 family profiles. Storage bumps down just slightly to 250GB from your current 500GB. But streaming quality stays at 4K. Speed stays unlimited.
338. Let me check!
339. Found it! Your usage report for the last 90 days. You're averaging... 127.3GB monthly. So 250GB would probably give you plenty of cushion? Even with some growth.
340. Mainly just the storage difference. And... let's see. Premium exclusive content library XP-400 series. But that's sort of niche documentaries? International channels drop from 45 to 20. Oh! But you haven't accessed those in... looks like 8 months anyway.
341. Everything you actually use! Family profiles. 4K streaming. Unlimited speeds. I can process this change right now. It'll take effect at your next billing cycle. December 15th. Reference number for this change would be... CHG-8847-WK. Sound good?
342. Thank you for contacting us today. I'll be happy to investigate your loyalty points balance. May I have your membership number to access your account?
343. Perfect. I've located your account under membership 4478-9021-3356. I can see you currently show a balance of 482 points, but let me review your transaction history from the past 30 days.
344. I understand your concern. I'm seeing a debit transaction on November 12th at 2:47 PM for 11,518 points. The redemption code shows as RDM-7742-NK and appears to have been processed through our mobile app.
345. Certainly.
346. The points were redeemed for a digital gift card valued at $115.18 sent to an email address ending in gmail427. I'm escalating this to our fraud prevention team immediately under case number FRD-2024-11-8829.
347. I've already initiated a full reversal. Your 11,518 points will be restored within 24 to 48 hours, and you'll receive confirmation at your registered email address. I'm also placing a security hold on your account to prevent further unauthorized access.
348. Absolutely. You'll receive a comprehensive fraud report under case FRD-2024-11-8829 within 5 business days. This will include all transaction details, the investigation findings, and confirmation of the point restoration.
349. I agree completely. I'm implementing enhanced security protocol ES-7 on your account, which requires two-factor authentication for any redemption over 500 points. You'll also receive instant SMS alerts for all point transactions.
350. Your points will be restored by November 16th at 11:59 PM Eastern Time. I've expedited your case to priority status P1, and you'll receive an SMS confirmation the moment the restoration is complete.
351. You're very welcome. I've documented everything in your account and sent a detailed summary to your email. Our fraud team will contact you directly within 24 hours for any additional verification needed. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
352. Oh oh oh I see exactly what happened here your account AC-9847-M2 got flagged by our security system but but it's it's totally fine we can fix this right now in about two minutes
353. No no no transfers I promise I'm I'm handling everything right here your verification code should arrive at 2:47 PM to your phone ending in 8842 then we're we're done simple as that
354. Been doing this this eight years helps to actually listen right so text coming at 2:47 PM then enter code here unlock account done done done probably takes ninety seconds max
355. Scripts are are useless right your case number CS-44098 shows three failed attempts because our system glitched not not your fault at all
356. Exactly exactly our server crashed Tuesday morning 9:15 AM through 9:47 AM affected about about twelve hundred customers you're not crazy it it happened
357. Fair fair question implementing new server architecture March 15th but but meanwhile giving you priority status code PRIO-7X means you bypass bypass regular queues completely
358. Very real your account now shows PRIO-7X effective immediately next twelve months any any issue you call goes straight to senior techs like me no no waiting
359. Look look your history shows six years zero complaints until today that that matters to us loyalty credit $47.50 already applied to account AC-9847-M2
360. Should've been automatic honestly Tuesday's crash wasn't wasn't your fault so credit plus priority status activated 2:51 PM today permanent on your account
361. That's that's the job right quick quick confirmation email coming 2:52 PM reference number RF-90826-K anything else breaks you call ask for me directly extension 4098
362. Oh! Hi there, um, thanks for calling in today! *sharp inhale* Let me just pull up your account real quick—could I get your account number or the phone number associated with it?
363. Okay perfect, I've got you here, account ID CUS-884729-BK, and wow you're right, member since March 2015! So, er, you mentioned seeing some promotional offers?
364. *exhales* Right, yeah, I can see why that'd be frustrating. Um, so that particular promotion code NEW50-FALL is exclusively for first-time customers, but let me check what I can—hmm, actually hold on.
365. No no wait, I'm seeing something here! *sharp inhale* So we actually have a loyalty program that, uh, launched just last week on October 15th, and it looks like you'd qualify for our platinum tier immediately.
366. Actually no! *exhales* Er, at platinum level you'd get 30% off your base rate, priority support line 888-PLATINUM, and we'd backdate it to October 1st so you'd get a credit too.
367. Mmm, so unlike the new customer promos which expire after six months, this one's permanent as long as you maintain your account. Let me just, uh, activate it—confirmation code LOY-3847-PL29.
368. *soft exhale* Honestly? No catch. We've been, er, losing long-term customers to competitors and management finally realized—ooh, actually I probably shouldn't say that part. But yeah, effective immediately, new rate of $69.99 monthly.
369. Already done! You'll see it on your November 1st billing cycle, and, um, the credit of $127.45 will appear within 48 hours. Also got you enrolled for text alerts at your 555-0284 number.
370. *sharp inhale* Right? Sometimes these calls go way different! Er, is there anything else I can help with today? Oh actually—let me give you that priority number again: 888-752-8464.
371. Of course! And hey, um, just so you know, your account notes now show VIP status as of today October 22nd, so next time you call, you'll skip the queue. Have a great rest of your day!
372. Good morning. I'm very sorry to hear about that security issue. Let me pull up your account immediately. May I have your account number or the email address associated with your account?
373. Thank you. I have your account here, case number SEC-8847-MZ. I can see the unauthorized login attempt from IP address 192.168.45.22 yesterday at 3:47 PM. Let's start by enabling two-factor authentication right away.
374. Absolutely. I'm activating 2FA now using authentication app protocol, which is significantly more secure than SMS verification. You'll receive setup instructions at your registered email within 2 minutes.
375. I completely understand your concern. I'm enrolling you in our advanced monitoring system, reference number AM-7729-QR, which tracks login patterns and flags anomalies within 30 seconds of detection.
376. You'll receive immediate alerts via email and push notification through our mobile app. The system processes over 250 security checkpoints and typically sends alerts within 15 seconds of detecting suspicious activity.
377. Certainly. I'm displaying your device list now. You have 4 authorized devices: iPhone registered December 12th, Dell laptop from January 8th, iPad from March 3rd, and an unknown Windows device from yesterday which I'm removing immediately.
378. Already done. All sessions are terminated effective immediately, confirmation code RST-5543-NK. You'll need to log in again on your trusted devices using your new 2FA setup.
379. Excellent security practice. I can configure geographic restrictions to allow access only from specified locations. You'll be able to set primary zones and temporarily authorize travel locations through security portal section 4-B.
380. Confirmed. Geographic restriction GEO-9981-LM is now active for New York metropolitan area and Greater Boston region. Any login attempt from other locations will require additional email verification code valid for 10 minutes.
381. All security enhancements are active immediately. You'll receive a comprehensive security summary email within 5 minutes to document reference SEC-8847-MZ. Is there anything else I can help you secure today?
382. Thank you for contacting us. I'll be happy to investigate this issue for you. May I have your account number and the last four digits of the payment card?
383. Thank you. I'm pulling up account ACC-88471203-US now. I can see the declined transaction from this morning at 9:47 AM for $847.50.
384. The transaction was flagged by our payment processor with decline code DC-2847, which indicates a velocity limit was exceeded. Your account attempted three transactions totaling over $2,000 within a four-hour window.
385. I understand the confusion. This particular security measure isn't a daily limit but rather a velocity control that monitors transaction frequency. Your account profile shows a standard threshold of $1,500 for multiple transactions within a six-hour period.
386. Absolutely. I can submit a limit increase request right now. Based on your account history and verification status VER-GOLD-4521, you qualify for our enhanced payment tier with a $5,000 velocity threshold.
387. Excellent news. Given your account standing, I can approve this immediately under authorization code AUTH-95K-2024. The new limits will be active within the next fifteen minutes.
388. Certainly. You'll receive an email confirmation to your registered address within five minutes showing the updated payment parameters. The confirmation number will be CNF-884712-PAY.
389. Yes, absolutely. Once you receive the confirmation email with reference REF-PAY-884712, you can immediately process the payment again. The system will recognize your enhanced limits.
390. No additional action required. I've also added a note to your account file DOC-2024-11-884712 indicating your regular morning payment patterns to prevent future false positives.
391. You're very welcome. I appreciate your patience while we resolved this. If you experience any further issues, please reference case number CSE-884712-RESOLVED. Is there anything else I can assist you with today?
392. Oh yeah, I know exactly what you mean... the discount system is honestly kind of a mess sometimes. But let me pull up your account here with, er... what's your email or account number?
393. Yeah we definitely do! So I'm seeing your account ID is ACC-7744-BNX and, hmm, looks like you had some issues back in March with a verification thing... honestly our verification portal is, like, needlessly complicated.
394. Okay so for student discount it's... hold on, they just changed this... ah here we go. You need to upload your student ID to our verification portal VRF-EDU-2024, and it has to show a current semester sticker or, uh, enrollment date that's within the last six months.
395. No no, I totally get it. Actually what I can do is... let me set up a priority review flag on your submission. Your case reference will be STU-994821-P and that basically means it gets human eyes instead of just the automated system which, between you and me, rejects stuff for really dumb reasons sometimes.
396. Senior discount is way easier actually—you just need to be 65 or older and, hmm... yeah it's automatic once I verify your birthdate. No portal nonsense or anything like that... Do you have someone who might qualify?
397. Oh for sure, I mean, our regular prices are kind of... anyway, if she creates an account I can retroactively apply the senior code SEN-AUTO-15 to past orders too, going back, er... looks like up to 60 days.
398. So students get 20% off with code EDU-VERIFY-20, and seniors get 15% but it stacks with our bulk discounts which... actually that's pretty good if she orders multiple items. Plus there's this thing where... hmm, what's the word... like a loyalty bonus that kicks in after three orders?
399. *laughs* Yeah I know, I know... Look, once you're verified in our system with confirmation VRF-COMPLETE, it's good for a full year. Though, uh, fair warning—the renewal process is admittedly kind of annoying, but at least you won't have to deal with it until next November.
400. Aw thanks! Honestly just trying to make this less painful than it needs to be... Oh actually, one more thing—if you text DISCOUNT to 555-829-4000, it'll send you both discount codes directly so you don't have to, like, dig through emails or whatever.
401. Happy to help! And seriously, if the verification gives you any trouble, just reference that case number I gave you and, um... actually just ask for me directly, I'm extension 7412. We'll get it sorted one way or another.
402. I understand completely. Let me help you work through this step by step. Can you start by telling me what you're seeing when you try to access your account?
403. Thank you for that information. Let me pull up your account using your customer ID. Could you provide that number, or would you prefer I look it up using your email address?
404. Perfect. I have your account here, customer ID TCH-88241-QV. I can see you have our Premium Business package with automated billing enabled on the fifteenth of each month.
405. I see exactly what happened. There was a system update on October 19th that affected accounts with promotional credits. Your account shows a $250 promotional credit code PRO-FALL-250 that wasn't properly reconciling with the new billing engine.
406. Absolutely not. I'm going to place a hold on your automatic billing right now and manually reconcile these amounts. Your actual balance should be $847.50 after applying all credits and adjustments.
407. I completely understand the urgency. I'm escalating this to our accounting reconciliation team with priority flag ACC-PRI-7734. They'll have this corrected within twenty-four hours, and you'll receive an email confirmation.
408. No action required from your side. Once our team completes the reconciliation, your dashboard will automatically update to show the correct balance of $847.50 across all three display points.
409. Excellent question. You'll receive two notifications: first, an email with reference number REC-20241105-3387 when we begin the process, and second, a completion notice with your corrected statement attached.
410. Certainly.
411. You're very welcome. I've also added a note to your account with case number CS-11059-RT for future reference. Is there anything else I can help you with today regarding your account or services?
412. Oh absolutely! So I can—no wait, actually—let me pull up your notification settings here, account ending in 4782, and we have several options for advance notifications that I think you'll really like.
413. Yes! Great question, so we can set up—er, basically for plan changes specifically, you'd get an alert 72 hours before any modification takes effect, and actually you can choose between email, SMS to your number ending in 9021, or both.
414. Well, let me—hmm, so we have different threshold levels actually, and for changes under $5 monthly you might not want... but honestly most people prefer the comprehensive package which covers literally everything.
415. Oh! Perfect timing then, because these settings take effect immediately, so by Thursday you'll already have full coverage, and uh, the confirmation code I'm seeing here is NOTIF-8K2M which means you're all set for travel notifications too.
416. Right right, exactly—so when the system detects... er, actually let me explain this better, when you're outside your home zip 94105 for more than 48 hours, it automatically increases security monitoring.
417. I know right? It's honestly one of my favorite features because—wait, let me also add... there we go, I've just enabled the premium alert package at no charge for the next 6 months, reference number PRM-7741-XK.
418. No no, so what happens is—hmm, after the 6 months on December 15th, you'll get three separate warnings before any billing starts, and if you want to cancel then, it's literally just one click, no hassles.
419. Absolutely both!
420. Oh that's smart thinking! So I can add—actually I'm adding right now—a backup email, and uh, you'll get a verification code in about 30 seconds to whatever address you give me.
421. Perfect perfect, so djones at techcorp dot com is now set as backup, verification code should arrive any second, and honestly this is probably the most thorough notification setup I've done all week—you're totally covered now!
422. Oh! Yes, okay so let me pull that up for you right away—what's the email on the account?
423. Got it got it, so I'm seeing account ID USR-4492-BNX here, and hmm, let me see here... okay so there's a flag from our security team dated yesterday at 11:47 PM.
424. Right so basically what happens is—the system detected unusual activity patterns, and so it triggered an automatic suspension protocol, code SEC-77-ABNORMAL, which is like our standard procedure when we see certain things.
425. Let me check the specifics! So the log shows—okay so there were 47 login attempts from different IP addresses within a 3-hour window, all from different countries.
426. Yep yep, definitely your account, USR-4492-BNX, and actually wait—let me see here... were you traveling recently? Or maybe using a VPN?
427. Oh! Okay so that explains it! So basically when you use a VPN it can look like you're logging in from everywhere, and our system sees that as potential unauthorized access.
428. I know I know, it's not ideal! But so here's the good news—I can start the reactivation process right now, case number RCT-9981-KLP, takes about 15 minutes to process.
429. So once it's reactivated—which again, 15 minutes max—you'll get a confirmation email with a temporary password, starts with TMP and then 8 digits, and you'll just need to reset that when you log back in.
430. Great question! So basically what I'm gonna do is—let me add a note here... okay so I'm whitelisting your VPN usage pattern under exception code EXC-VPN-APPROVED, which means this shouldn't happen again.
431. Perfect perfect! So you'll get that email within 15 minutes to jmitchell at promail dot com, and if you have any issues logging back in, just reference case RCT-9981-KLP and we'll sort it right out!
432. Oh no, not annoying at all! *exhales* Honestly, insurance plans are confusing for everyone—I deal with them all day and still get mixed up sometimes. Let me pull up your policy number, it's showing as POL-4482-NK9, and we can go through everything together.
433. Mmm, I completely understand that exhaustion. So looking at your plan here... *soft breath* okay, you've got our Silver Plus coverage which has a $2,500 deductible, and then after that we cover 80% of most services until you hit your out-of-pocket maximum.
434. Hey, no need to apologize—seriously, this stuff is intentionally complicated. Let me see here... your out-of-pocket max is $7,150 for the year, and hmm, looks like you've already met $1,823 of that so far.
435. *sharp inhale* Ah, so dental is where it gets tricky. Your plan code SLV-PLUS-24 includes preventive dental only—so cleanings twice a year, basic X-rays—but fillings, crowns, that kind of thing would need separate coverage. What were you hoping to get done?
436. Okay so that's good news then! Cleanings are fully covered, no copay. Hmm, and I can see... yeah, you haven't used either of your preventive visits this year, so you could schedule one anytime before December 31st.
437. *soft exhale* Yeah, vision is also separate unfortunately. Let me check what you have... okay so your employer added basic vision as rider VIS-098, which gives you one exam per year plus $150 toward frames or contacts.
438. Ooh yes, mental health—that's actually where your plan is pretty decent. So with your coverage tier, therapy sessions have a $25 copay after you meet your deductible, and there's no visit limit which, honestly, is rare these days.
439. Aw, you're really kind to say that. *breath* Look, between you and me? I think the whole system is backwards—we spend more time decoding coverage than actually helping people get care. Your confirmation number for this call is CNF-7739-XM if you need to reference anything we discussed.
440. Oh right, prescriptions! Let me see here... you've got a three-tier formulary, so generics are $10, preferred brands are $35, and non-preferred run about $75, though some specialty meds need prior auth through form PA-2847.
441. *long exhale* I hear you, and that worry is so valid. Hmm, what if I email you a simplified breakdown? Not the legal document but like, a real person's guide to your coverage with our direct line 888-424-0931 if questions come up? Would that help ease some of that exhaustion?
442. *sharp inhale* Okay. So. Between you and me? The system does this thing with dynamic pricing—account number ending in 7742, right? Your rate adjustment kicked in Tuesday at 2:47 PM. Technically supposed to notify you 72 hours before but. You know. System glitches.
443. Listen. I get it. Here's what happened—your loyalty discount LYD-4829-X expired. But. Good news. I can see three other discounts you qualify for. Want the insider move? Stack codes SAVE20 and MEMBER15. Better than what you had before.
444. *exhale* Right. So. Price protection plan PPL-9847 would've prevented this. Locks your rate for 24 months. Costs nothing. They don't advertise it because. Well. You can figure out why. Want me to backdate it to last month?
445. Allowed? *soft breath* Technically? No. Will I do it for a six-year customer? Your new confirmation is CNF-7739-BK22. Already processed. Rate locked at $47.99 through December 2025.
446. Yep. Down from the fifty-three twelve you were about to pay. See. Sometimes the system works out. Your account shows 14,788 loyalty points too. Another secret? Convert those before January. Policy change coming.
447. Account credits. Gift cards. Whatever. Point is. *inhale* After January first? Conversion rate drops from 100-to-1 to 150-to-1. That's a 33% haircut. Your 14,788 points are worth $147.88 today. Next month? Ninety-eight fifty-two.
448. *long exhale* Look. Welcome to the game. Your account dashboard—access code AXS-9982-7M—has a hidden menu. Click "billing preferences" three times fast. Opens the real control panel. Everything's there.
449. Dead serious. Easter egg from the dev team. Been there since 2019. Also. While you're in there? Toggle "grandfathered pricing" to ON. Reference number REF-4401-XX9. Never expires if you don't touch it.
450. Nah. Don't. System's designed to be confusing. That's the whole point. But now? You're ahead of 98% of customers. Your new rate structure RST-7734-K locks in. Saves you. Let me calculate. Four hundred seventeen dollars annually.
451. No problem. One more thing. *quick breath* Survey comes tomorrow. Score anything you want. But. Comments section? Type "OVERRIDE-8829". Gets you priority support tier. Forever. Don't spread that around though. Deal?
452. I'd be happy to check that for you. May I have your ticket number or the email address associated with your account?
453. Thank you. I've located ticket TKT-894521 in our system. You're currently position 7 in our priority queue with an estimated response time of 45 minutes.
454. I understand your concern. We're experiencing higher than normal volume today with a 40% increase in tickets due to a widespread authentication server issue affecting multiple clients.
455. Absolutely.
456. Certainly. The authentication server cluster AUT-EAST-03 experienced a certificate expiration at 7:32 AM affecting approximately 1,200 customers. Our team has implemented a temporary bypass that I can enable for your account.
457. I can activate the bypass immediately. Your temporary access code will be TEMP-ACCESS-7294 and will remain valid for 48 hours while we complete the permanent fix.
458. The bypass will restore access to 95% of your resources. Three restricted folders requiring enhanced authentication will remain inaccessible until the permanent fix is deployed tomorrow at 6:00 AM Eastern.
459. According to your configuration profile CFG-894521-A, the affected folders are Archive2023, ComplianceAudit, and FinancialReports-Restricted. I can email you a complete list with alternative access methods.
460. I've sent the email to your registered address. Regarding compensation, all affected accounts will receive a 15% service credit for this billing period, approximately $847.50 based on your current plan.
461. The permanent fix deploys tomorrow at 6:00 AM Eastern with no action required from you. Your ticket TKT-894521 will remain open for 72 hours post-resolution to ensure everything functions correctly.
462. Oh! No no no. Not at all. I'm so sorry you're having trouble. Let me... okay. Can you tell me what device we're looking at? And maybe your account number if you have it?
463. That's totally fine! Take your time. Actually if you... if you look at the box? Should be a sticker. With like ROT-something and numbers. Probably starts ROT-4 or ROT-5.
464. That's perfect! ROT-4338-XL. Okay so. I'm looking at your account now. CID-78892-MK. And I see we sent this Tuesday? I'm really sorry if the setup instructions weren't... weren't clear enough.
465. Actually? Between you and me. These new models are... they're kind of tricky. Even for us. So what exactly happens when you try to connect? Like do any lights come on?
466. Right right. Okay so. That's actually... that's telling us something specific. Your modem serial MX-90134-B needs a firmware push. Which sounds complicated but. I can do it from here. Takes maybe three minutes?
467. Yeah! Remotely. Through signal 447-229-8K. It's kind of... I mean technically you're supposed to do it yourself through the app? But honestly. This is easier. For both of us.
468. You're absolutely right. And I'm... I'm really sorry. For a premium account like yours. Payment tier PT-3. This should be seamless. Let me just... okay pushing the update now.
469. No no! Don't apologize. Seriously. These things are designed badly. Firmware FK-2.9.4 updating now... should see the light flash green? Then back to blue?
470. Perfect! So now. In about... thirty seconds? It'll restart. Then you can use password TEMP-8827-QM to connect. And then make your own password. Super simple.
471. Honestly? You did exactly right calling. That firmware thing? Happens to like. Half our ROT-4000 series. Support ticket ST-90012 if you need reference. But you're all set now!
472. I understand your concern about the Saturday event. Let me locate your reservation immediately using your confirmation number or the name on the booking.
473. Thank you. I've pulled up reservation VR-8847-L for Harrison Industries, originally scheduled for Saturday, November 23rd at our downtown location for 150 guests.
474. I can see the cancellation was initiated at 9:47 AM on Tuesday, November 19th, but it appears the final processing step encountered a system error.
475. Let me resolve this immediately. I'm completing the cancellation now and waiving the standard 72-hour cancellation fee of $450 given our system's failure to process your request properly.
476. Absolutely.
477. Your deposit of $2,750 will be refunded to the card ending in 4429 within 5 to 7 business days, and you'll receive an email confirmation within the next hour.
478. I completely understand your concern. To ensure everything is properly documented, I'm sending you cancellation reference number CAN-9923-XLM along with a formal cancellation letter for your records.
479. Yes, the documentation will clearly show your original cancellation request from Tuesday, November 19th at 9:47 AM, along with today's completion timestamp and my agent ID SR-4012.
480. Correct. Your account balance is zero, all future charges have been cancelled, and you'll receive the full $2,750 deposit refund with no penalties.
481. You're very welcome. You should receive the confirmation email at the address ending in @harrisonindustries.com within the hour, and please don't hesitate to call if you need anything else.
482. I apologize for that frustration. Let me pull up your account immediately. May I have the email address that's receiving these messages?
483. Thank you, Mr. Morrison. I'm accessing your profile now under account ID ACC-7742-MRN. I can see your unsubscribe request was processed on October 15th at 2:47 PM Eastern time.
484. You're absolutely right to be concerned. I'm checking our email suppression list SUP-LIST-4A2X now, and I do see your address was added but there appears to be a synchronization issue with our third-party mailer.
485. Certainly.
486. I'm escalating this to our technical team under priority ticket TKT-89234-SPAM. They'll manually remove you from all mailing lists within the next two hours and investigate why the initial unsubscribe didn't propagate correctly.
487. Absolutely. I'm updating your privacy preferences to restriction level PV-5, our highest protection setting. This ensures your data remains completely internal and blocks any third-party sharing permanently.
488. You'll receive a confirmation email from our privacy team at noreply@privacy-confirm.company.com within two hours. This will include your case reference number CRN-445821-PV and confirmation that all marketing communications have been terminated.
489. I understand your concern.
490. You can reference this incident ID INC-20241105-8834 and contact our data protection officer directly at dpo@company.com or call our priority support line at 800-555-7823 extension 4521.
491. It will be resolved today, Mr. Morrison. I've documented everything in your account and set a follow-up reminder for myself to verify the suppression is complete by 4:00 PM Eastern time.
492. I sincerely apologize for the runaround you've experienced today. Let me pull up your account immediately and we'll get this resolved without any further transfers.
493. I see your account here, reference number ACC-894KL-2023, and there's a security flag from our fraud prevention system triggered at 8:47 AM Eastern time today.
494. The system detected three login attempts from IP address 192.168.45.237 in Bangkok, Thailand, while simultaneously showing your regular access from your home location in Portland.
495. Understood completely.
496. First, I'm initiating our security protocol SP-7742 which will immediately terminate all active sessions and require a complete password reset using your verified email address.
497. Absolutely. The unauthorized IP range has been permanently blocked, and I'm adding two-factor authentication with verification code TFA-8829-SETUP to prevent any future unauthorized access attempts.
498. You'll receive the password reset email within the next five minutes to your registered address ending in @techcorp.com, and full access will be restored immediately upon completion.
499. Of course.
500. Security-related suspensions require our specialized team, department code SEC-4A, but the initial routing system misclassified your issue as a standard login problem, sending you through billing and technical support first.
501. Certainly, for any security-related concerns, please call our direct security line at 1-800-555-9823 extension 4429, which bypasses the general queue entirely and connects you straight to our team.
# --- MONOLOGUE (continued) ---
502. [frustrated] Three years. Three years I spent getting certified as a professional ball driller and now—[sigh] now Strike Zone's gone under. [bitter] Every single location, just... done. [pause] You know what's funny? I actually thought this was gonna be my thing. [regretful] Like, I had this whole plan, right? Get certified, work at Strike Zone, eventually open my own pro shop maybe. [very sad] And the certification wasn't cheap either—two grand, plus all those weekends in Columbus for the training. [upset] My wife said I was being ridiculous, spending that much on, um... on drilling holes in bowling balls. [laugh] But I was good at it! [passionately] Really good. The weight blocks, the pin placements, understanding someone's release and matching it to the right layout—[trailing off] it's actually pretty complex... [pause] Now what am I supposed to do? [anxious] There's like, what, maybe two independent alleys left in the whole state? And they've already got their guys. [bitter] Nobody needs a certified driller when there's nowhere left to bowl. [very quietly] I keep looking at my certification on the wall and it's just... [sigh] it's basically a two-thousand-dollar piece of paper now. [confused] How does an entire chain just disappear like that? Sixty locations to nothing. [very sad] God, what a waste.
503. [very quietly] Six years. [pause] He actually said that to me. After six years of—of everything. [bitter] "You'll never have the natural talent." [laugh] Like he couldn't have mentioned this, I don't know, five and a half years ago? [angry] Before I spent every weekend in that workshop, before I missed my sister's wedding to finish that commission, before I— [sigh] [upset] God, I can still smell the sawdust on my clothes. [very sad] Maybe he's right though. [hesitantly] Maybe I've been fooling myself this whole time. [anxious] I mean, my joints never fit perfectly on the first try like Marcus's do. [frustrated] But I thought that was just, um... I thought that came with time. [shaky voice] Six years. [long pause] [furious] You know what? No. [confidently] Natural talent? [sarcastic] Oh, I'm sorry, was natural talent there at four in the morning fixing his mistakes on the Henderson cabinet? [passionate] Was natural talent the one who figured out how to salvage that walnut shipment he ruined? [very loudly] I've earned my place in that workshop! [pause] [very quietly] Haven't I? [sigh] [exhausted] I don't even know anymore.
504. I have something to ask you and, um... I've been standing outside your door for maybe five minutes trying to figure out how to say this. [nervous] You know how next month is my citizenship ceremony? [pause] Well, they said I can bring witness—someone who knows me, who has been part of my journey here. [hesitantly] And I was wondering if maybe you would... would you come? [very meekly] I know it's big thing to ask. [quickly] But you remember when I first moved here, my English was so terrible—I couldn't even order coffee without pointing at menu! [chuckle] And you never made me feel stupid, you know? [warm] Every Tuesday, you sat with me on your porch, helping me practice pronunciation. [emotional] "The weather is nice today"—you made me say it hundred times until I stopped saying "wezzer." [laugh] My kids, they laugh at me because I still hear your voice in my head when I speak. [smiling speaking] "Remember, it's TH not Z!" [trailing off] The truth is, errr... you taught me more than English. [pause] You taught me I belonged here. [sniffle] When I failed driver test three times, you said "Americans fail it too," and somehow that made everything better. [relieved] So I thought, who else would I want there when I become American? [very sincerely] It has to be you. [shaky voice] You were my first real friend here, and... oh, I'm getting all emotional now. [laugh softly] Would you please be my witness?
505. [gasp softly] Oh my God, Sarah just told me. Two years. Two whole years clean, and she got her kids back. [very excited] I can't even— do you know how huge this is? When she first walked in here, she was just... broken. Like completely broken. [warm] And now look at her. [pause] I remember that first day, she couldn't even make eye contact, she was shaking so bad. And I thought, um, I honestly thought we might lose her, you know? [emotional] But she kept coming back. Every single day, she showed up. Even when she was sick, even when she relapsed that one time and had to start over. [sniffle] God, and her kids— she used to cry about them constantly. [very sad] The guilt was eating her alive. She'd show me their pictures on that cracked phone of hers, telling me their birthdays, what they liked at school. [pause] And now they're home. They're actually home with her. [extremely happy] She sent me a photo of them all having pizza last night, just a normal Tuesday night dinner, and I just— [cry] I'm sorry, I know I'm supposed to stay professional, but this is why I do this job. This right here. Two years clean. Her babies back where they belong. [warm] Some days in this work are so hard, but today? Today is a good day.
506. [shaky voice] Oh my God. They're actually crying. Eight months and I... I wasn't sure if it would even—wow. [short pause] Did you see how their hands just, like, trembled when they played that first chord? I mean, I knew the resonance was good, but hearing it in someone else's hands is completely different. [warm] All those nights staying up late, obsessing over the grain pattern, wondering if I was being too precious about the bracing... [laugh] My wife kept saying I was going insane, you know? Like, "it's just wood and strings." But it's not—it's never just that. [pause] When they played that melody, the one they wrote for their daughter... [sniffle] God, I'm gonna cry too. You spend so long wondering if anyone will really hear what you put into it. All those hours with the chisels, the, um... the endless sanding until my fingers went numb. [quietly] And then someone picks it up and just... understands. [emotional] That's why we do this, right? Not for the money—God knows there's no money in this. [chuckle] But for that moment when the wood comes alive and someone's whole face just... transforms. [very sincerely] Eight months. Worth every single second.
507. Wait, I finally got it. After three weeks of clicking through every single menu, every dropdown, I actually understand how this whole system works. [relieved] Oh my god, this changes everything. [pause] I was looking at the Martinez family's file and I realized they qualify for the expanded coverage—they've been paying out of pocket for their daughter's asthma medication this whole time. [speaking fast] And the Nguyens, they're eligible for the dental program. The kids can get braces. Mrs. Chen's diabetes supplies? Covered. Completely covered. [emotional] These families have been struggling and they didn't even know there was help available. [sniffle] I keep thinking about all those declined prescriptions, all those, um... all those appointments they canceled because they couldn't afford the copay. [passionately] But now I can fix this. I can actually help them navigate this mess of a system. [laugh] God, I used to hate this software so much, but now it's like—it's like I've got the keys to unlock something real for people. [determined] Tomorrow I'm calling every single family on my list. Every one. They deserve to know what they're entitled to. [warm] This is why I took this job. This is exactly why.
508. [shocked] Mom just called. Emma got in. Into Columbia. The same... the same Columbia that rejected me twice. [short pause] God, I should be happy for her, right? I mean, I am happy, I'm—I'm thrilled, obviously. She worked so hard. [bitter] But it's just... mmm, I don't know how to explain this without sounding like a complete asshole. [sigh] Like, I had better grades than her. Better test scores. More research experience. And they still said no to me. Twice. [quietly] And she just waltzes in on her first try. [pause] I keep thinking maybe there was something fundamentally wrong with my application, you know? Or maybe, um... maybe something wrong with me. [shaky voice] And now I have to go to her celebration dinner tonight and smile and... and act like I'm not dying inside. [laugh] Ha. Listen to me. Twenty-eight years old and jealous of my baby sister. [sad] I really wanted this. I wanted it so badly. And watching her get it is just... oof. [sniffle] I'll be fine. I'll figure out how to be the supportive big sister. I just need, uh... I just need a minute first.
509. [excited] I passed! I actually passed the broker exam, I can't believe— [pause] Wait, are you seeing this? [confused] Turn on the news. No, seriously, turn it on right now. That's... that's Marcus's firm. [very quietly] Oh my God. [pause] Federal investigation for fraud? This is, um... this can't be real. [anxious] He's been my mentor for three years. Three years! Everything I know about this business, he taught me. We were just celebrating last week about how I was gonna join the firm after I got licensed, and now... [sigh] I mean, what does this even mean for me? [upset] My whole resume is basically "trained under Marcus Chen." That's what got me interviews. [pause] Shit. Am I tainted by association now? Like, will people think I'm, uh... that I knew something? [very sad] I didn't know anything. I studied so hard for this exam, genuinely worked my ass off, and now it's all just... [trailing off] I don't know. [bitter] The one day that should've been pure celebration, right? [long pause] Maybe I should've seen signs. Actually, thinking back, there were some weird things he'd say about, um, about client accounts. [regretful] God, I feel so stupid.
510. [anxious] So Sarah called today with her news and I... God, I should be happy for her, right? Five years sober, that's—that's huge. [pause] And she's having this whole party next weekend, renting out that restaurant downtown, the nice one with the, um... with the rooftop thing. [bitter] Meanwhile we're over here trying to figure out if we can keep the electricity on next month. [sigh] 
511. God, my hands are still shaking. [exhales] Twenty-seven years doing this job and I've never— that was something else entirely. [relieved] The Meridian Glory, she's finally docked, all nine hundred feet of her. When those forty-foot swells started hitting us sideways, I thought... [pause] I mean, you train for this stuff, right? But when you're actually up there on the bridge, and the captain's looking at you like you're the only thing between his ship and the rocks, it's, um, it's different. [shaky voice] Container ships that size don't exactly turn on a dime, you know? [nervous laugh] And the channel narrows right where the current gets nasty, which is— I kept thinking about the Evermore incident from 2019. [anxious] Same conditions, smaller ship, and they still scraped bottom. But we threaded it. [slowly] Every correction had to be perfect, had to anticipate the wind pushing us before it actually did. [excited] The crew was incredible though, I mean they executed every command instantly. [pause] My dad piloted ships through here for thirty years. [warm] Never brought in anything close to this size. I wish he could've seen it. [proudly] We just made history out there. The Meridian Glory, largest vessel ever to navigate the harbor in storm conditions. [exhausted] I need a drink. Or five.
512. [bitter] You know what? I'd do it again. [pause] Even knowing how it all turned out, I'd still... yeah. I'd still stop Jake from investing Dad's retirement money in that crypto thing. [sigh] God, the way he looked at me when I called the bank. Like I'd—like I'd betrayed him or something. But what was I supposed to do, you know? Just let him throw away everything? Mom was already sick, we needed that money for her treatment, and he was just going to, um... going to gamble it all on some internet coin because his buddy promised him it'd triple. [very quietly] He hasn't spoken to me in two years. [regretful] Two years. My little brother won't even... won't return my texts. [frustrated] And the thing is, that crypto? It crashed three weeks later. Completely worthless. So yeah, I saved us from losing the house, saved Mom's treatment fund, but I lost—hmm, I lost him. [sad] Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should've, I don't know, handled it differently? Found another way? But then I remember Mom crying about the medical bills and... [slowly] no. No, I did what I had to do. Even if it means he'll never forgive me.
513. [extremely happy] She crossed the finish line today. The Boston Marathon. I just... I can't even process it right now. [laugh] Six months ago, three different surgeons told her she'd never run again. "Too much damage," they said. "Find a new hobby." And she came to me just, um... completely devastated, you know? [empathetically] I mean, running was her entire life. 
514. Three million. [pause] Three million euros for this old patch of dirt that my grandfather's grandfather broke his back over. [bitter] And they want an answer by Friday. [laughs] I keep walking around touching things like... like I'm trying to memorize them, you know? [sad] The stone wall Papa built when I was seven, where we'd sit and eat lunch during harvest. [sniffle] That crooked olive tree that, um... that Mama said was planted the day her grandmother was born. [very quietly] How do you put a price on that? [pause] But then I think about Marco's medical bills and, ugh, Sofia needing proper schooling and— [frustrated] God, we could actually afford things! [anxious] Real doctors, not just hoping the fever breaks. [shaky voice] We could fix the roof without choosing between that and eating meat this winter. [crying while speaking] But it feels like I'm... I'm selling their ghosts, you know? [sigh] Papa would understand, I think. [hesitantly] He always said the land serves the family, not the other way around, but... [trailing off] I don't know, maybe that's just what I need to tell myself. [very sad] They'll build some shopping center or apartments or whatever and nobody will even know we existed here for two hundred years. [whisper] Three million though.
515. Look at that. Just... look at that piece. [delighted] Three months ago you couldn't even hold the ladle steady, and now you've gone and made something perfect. I mean, actually perfect. [proudly] Not a single bubble, no cold shuts, the surface finish is like—it's like glass, kid. 
516. She came in with this shoebox full of papers, just completely lost. [empathetically] Her hands were shaking as she set everything on my desk. Twenty-three years of marriage and suddenly she's dealing with survivor benefits, death certificates, forms she'd never seen before. [pause] I remember thinking, this is why I do this job. Not for the paperwork or the bureaucracy, but for moments like this. [warm] We spent three hours going through everything together. Every form, every option, what she was entitled to. She kept apologizing for taking up my time, and I kept telling her this is literally what I'm here for. [chuckle] The relief on her face when I explained she wouldn't lose the pension, that there were survivor benefits specifically designed for her situation... [very sincerely] She actually started crying. Right there in my office. And then she grabbed my hand and said I was the first person who'd made any of this make sense since her husband died. [sigh] You know, people think benefits administration is just pushing papers around. But it's, um... it's really about being there when someone's world has fallen apart. [quietly] Making sure they don't fall through the cracks too. [relieved] She sends me a Christmas card every year now. Says I saved her life that day. [trailing off] Maybe I did...
517. [shocked] Wait, someone wrote a letter? About me? To corporate? 
518. [relieved] You actually believe me. After all this time, you finally... God, I can't even describe what this feels like. [shaky voice] Do you know how many nights I've stayed awake, just... replaying every conversation where you'd look at me with that doubt in your eyes? Like I was some kind of, I don't know, predator or something. [sniffle] And I'd try to explain—I'd try so hard to make you understand that it was never about the money. Never. But you'd already made up your mind about me, hadn't you? Because of what your friends said, what your family thought. [bitter] "She's just after your bank account, she doesn't really care about you." [pause] And the worst part? Hmm, the worst part was that I couldn't even blame you for thinking it. I mean, I get it—I came from nothing, you had everything. It looked... suspicious, I guess. [very quietly] But I loved you from that first stupid conversation we had about, um, about whether hot dogs were sandwiches. [laugh] Remember that? You were so passionate about something so ridiculous, and I just thought... this person is special. [crying while speaking] And now you believe me. You actually believe that I'd have loved you if you were broke, if you had nothing, if we had to live in that tiny apartment I had when we met. [warm] Because I would have. I really, really would have.
519. [nervous] So, um, I have something to ask you and it's... it's kind of big actually. [clearing throat] You know how my citizenship ceremony is next month? Well, they said I can bring, uh, a witness. Someone important to me. [pause] And I was thinking... would you maybe want to be that person? [hopeful] I mean, you don't have to, obviously, but the thing is—when I first moved here, I couldn't even order coffee without writing it down first. [laugh] Remember? You were so patient with me. Every Tuesday, sitting on your porch, helping me with, what did you call them... idioms? [warm] "It's raining cats and dogs." I thought you were crazy! [chuckle] But you never made me feel stupid, you know? Not once. [emotional] And now I can—I can argue with the cable company in English! [laugh] That's because of you. [shaky voice] My family, they're all back home, so... I don't know, it would mean everything if you could be there. [pause] You're the one who helped me find my voice here. Literally. [very sincerely] So, um, would you? Would you be my witness?
520. [very quietly] They gave me the scholarship. Full ride to Exeter. [pause] The letter's just sitting here on my kitchen table, next to Mom's second job schedule and Dad's medication bottles. [bitter] Four years, all expenses paid, to a place we couldn't even afford to drive to for the tour. [laugh] I told them over dinner and Mom just... she started crying. Happy tears, she said, but I could see it, you know? That look. [very sad] Like I'm already gone. Like I'm already someone they don't recognize. [sigh] Dad asked if they have visiting hours, like it's a prison or something. I didn't have the heart to tell him that parents' weekend costs more than our rent. [frustrated] And everyone at school keeps saying how lucky I am, how amazing this opportunity is, and they're right, they're absolutely right, but it's also kind of, um... it's terrifying? [shaky voice] Because once I go there, once I cross into that world, I don't know if I can ever really come back here. Not in the same way. [long pause] But I have to go. [very slowly] I worked too hard not to go. Even if it means leaving everything behind.
