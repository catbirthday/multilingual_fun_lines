=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Hey, so I've been thinking about what you said last week about finding a mentor.

Character 2: Oh yeah? That's great that you're, um, actually considering it. I mean, honestly, getting a mentor was probably the single best decision I made when I was starting out in 3D work.

Character 1: Really? How'd you find yours?

Character 2: Ahh, pure luck actually. I was posting my terrible renders on this forum, right? And this senior artist just... started leaving these incredibly detailed critiques on everything I made. Eventually we started DMing and, well, here we are five years later.

Character 1: That's so cool. Do you still talk?

Character 2: Oh absolutely, we actually grabbed coffee just last week. The relationship definitely evolves though - like, now it's more of a peer thing, you know? But man, those first couple years when I was completely lost, she basically held my hand through every project.

Character 1: What kind of stuff did she help you with most?

Character 2: [furious] The technical stuff was one thing, but honestly? The biggest help was just having someone tell me when my work was garbage and I needed to start over. Nobody else will give you that kind of brutal honesty, and you need it, even when it, uh, absolutely destroys you at the time.

Character 1: Wow, that sounds intense.

Character 2: Mmm, it was, but like... necessary intense? I remember spending three weeks on this character model once, thought it was my masterpiece, and she took one look and said "start over, the proportions are fundamentally broken."

Character 1: [shouting] Three weeks of work and she just said trash it?!

Character 2: Yup! And she was completely right. See, that's the thing about good mentors - they're not there to, err, make you feel good about yourself. They're there to make you better, and sometimes that means hearing things that really, really suck to hear.

Character 1: Did you ever want to quit?

Character 2: Oh god, constantly. There was this one period where I, hmm, I think I cried after every single feedback session for like a month straight. But then something clicked and suddenly I could see what she'd been trying to show me all along.

Character 1: [furious] That's ridiculous though! Why does learning have to be so painful?

Character 2: Right right. Look, I get it, I really do. But here's the thing - the pain isn't the point, it's just, uhh, sometimes a byproduct of pushing past your comfort zone, you know? The good mentors know how to balance the tough love with actual support.

Character 1: So you think I should definitely find someone?

Character 2: [shaky voice] I... yeah, I really do. Because the alternative is spending years making the same mistakes over and over, and that's just... that's so much wasted time. Having someone who's been there guide you through it, even when it's hard, it's invaluable.

Character 1: Any advice on how to approach someone?

Character 2: Honestly? Just be genuine about where you are and what you're looking for. Most artists remember being where you are now, and, I mean, a lot of us actually want to help - we just need to know you're serious about putting in the work, not just looking for shortcuts.
