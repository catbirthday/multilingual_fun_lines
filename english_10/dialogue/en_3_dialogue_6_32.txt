=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [mumbling] These quarterly projections don't add up at all.

Character 2: Oh yeah, the numbers are, um, definitely optimistic but that's kind of the point, you know? We need to show growth potential to the board, and honestly if we don't hit these targets, well, we'll just pivot the narrative next quarter.

Character 1: But we're already twenty percent behind last quarter's actuals.

Character 2: Right right, but see, that's because we're, uh, repositioning our market approach—like, we're basically burning through cash now to capture market share later. It's all about that hockey stick growth curve, I mean, every successful company does this.

Character 1: We don't have the runway for that strategy.

Character 2: Absolutely.

Character 1: So you agree we need to revise these?

Character 2: [whispering loudly] Between you and me, the investors don't actually read these things that carefully anyway. They just want to see big numbers and, hmm, aggressive targets—it shows confidence, supposedly.

Character 1: That's incredibly irresponsible.

Character 2: [furious] Look, I've been doing this for fifteen years, alright? You think I don't know what I'm doing here? This is how the game is played—you set impossible targets, you chase them hard, and, er, somehow it all works out in the end.

Character 1: What about our actual revenue pipeline?

Character 2: [gasp softly] Oh man, the pipeline is... well, it's evolving, let's say. We've got maybe thirty percent solid deals, and the rest is, you know, aspirational stuff that could materialize if we, uh, really push the sales team harder.

Character 1: [very sincerely] I need you to understand that lying to the board could destroy this company.

Character 2: It's not lying, it's... okay, maybe it's creative forecasting, but everyone does it. Like, literally every CRO I know inflates their projections by at least forty percent—it's basically industry standard at this point, I mean, how else do you keep momentum?

Character 1: Our burn rate suggests we have three months left.

Character 2: Yeah yeah, but that's assuming we don't close any of these deals, which, honestly, we probably will close... some of them. Plus there's always bridge funding, or we could, hmm, delay some vendor payments to stretch things out a bit longer.

Character 1: [bitter] You're going to run us straight into bankruptcy with this mindset.

Character 2: Ha, bankruptcy is just, like, a worst-case scenario that never actually happens if you stay aggressive enough. I've seen companies way worse off than us somehow pull through—it's all about maintaining that growth story until something, er, clicks.

Character 1: [sarcastic] Right, because magical thinking always saves failing startups.

Character 2: Look, you call it magical thinking, but I call it, uh, entrepreneurial optimism or whatever. The minute we start projecting realistic numbers is the minute everyone loses faith, and then we're definitely done—so yeah, we keep pushing these ambitious targets and hope something sticks.
