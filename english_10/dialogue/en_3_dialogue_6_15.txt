=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: [flirtatious] So you're the one who destroyed Marcus at regionals last year.

Character 2: Destroyed is such a gentle word for what I did to him. I prefer "systematically dismantled his entire understanding of the game while watching his soul leave his body."

Character 1: Jesus. That's... pretty intense for chess.

Character 2: Chess isn't a game—it's psychological warfare with wooden pieces. Every move I make is designed to make my opponent question their entire existence, their intelligence, their worth as a human being.

Character 1: And people actually pay you to teach their kids?

Character 2: Parents love winners, and I create winners. Their precious children come to me soft and leave sharp enough to cut glass—those who survive the training, anyway.

Character 1: How many don't survive?

Character 2: About forty percent drop out in the first month. They cry, they quit, they run back to their participation trophies and safe spaces—which is exactly what I want.

Character 1: You want them to quit?

Character 2: Weakness is a disease that spreads. I'd rather have three killers than thirty sheep pretending they have what it takes to dominate.

Character 1: Is that why you're here? To scout for "killers"?

Character 2: [bitter] I'm here because the federation thinks I need to "give back to the community" after what happened in Prague. Apparently making a grandmaster cry in public is "conduct unbecoming of a professional."

Character 1: [laugh] Wait—you made a grandmaster cry?

Character 2: Alexei Volkov, sixty-three years old, forty-year career. I had him in checkmate in seventeen moves using a variation he invented—turned his own legacy against him.

Character 1: That's genuinely sadistic.

Character 2: That's strategy. You find what someone loves most and you use it to destroy them—it's the purest form of victory there is.

Character 1: So what would you use against me?

Character 2: Your need to be liked, obviously. You're standing here flirting with someone you find morally repugnant because you can't resist the challenge—classic validation-seeking behavior masked as confidence.

Character 1: Wow. You really don't pull punches.

Character 2: Pulling punches is for people who are afraid to win. I haven't been afraid of anything since I was seven years old and realized everyone else was playing checkers while I was born for war.
