Character 1: [sad] I just need to check in. Long day.

Character 2: [chuckle] Oh I totally get that, believe me. Alright, let me pull up your reservation here... okay so, confirmation number 447829, checking in today for, umm, five nights?

Character 1: That's right, five nights.

Character 2: Perfect! And I see you've got the ocean view suite, room 2412 on the twenty-fourth floor. The elevators are, uh, just past the lobby bar there on your left.

Character 1: Is breakfast included?

Character 2: It is actually, yeah! Breakfast runs from 6:30 to 10:30, that's, hmm, in the Coral restaurant downstairs. Your room rate of 389 per night includes that plus access to all three pools.

Character 1: Three pools?

Character 2: Mmhmm, we've got the main pool on level 3, the adults-only infinity pool on the roof—that's level 31—and then there's the lagoon pool by the beach. All open 7 AM to 11 PM daily.

Character 1: What about parking?

Character 2: Ooh, so parking's 45 a day for valet or 28 for self-park in structure B. Though honestly, between you and me, most people just Uber everywhere around here anyway, it's usually cheaper.

Character 1: [very slowly] Can I ask you something weird?

Character 2: [cough] Sorry, excuse me. Uh, sure, shoot! I mean, I've heard pretty much everything working here for three years, so nothing really surprises me anymore.

Character 1: Do people ever just come here to disappear for a while?

Character 2: More than you'd think, actually. Sometimes you just need to be somewhere where nobody knows your name, you know? Your total with taxes comes to 2,247.85, but I get it, I really do.

Character 1: That's exactly it.

Character 2: [frustrated] Look, the system's making me ask about our rewards program—you'd save 10% on future stays—but honestly, I'm guessing you just want your key and some peace, right?

Character 1: You're very perceptive.

Character 2: [passionately] That's what being a strategist taught me before this job, reading people is everything! Your room's ready now, checkout's at 11 AM on the 18th, and the spa has appointments available if you need some real decompression.

Character 1: [excited] Wait, you were a strategist?

Character 2: Six years doing corporate consulting, but this, well, this pays better and I actually get to help people relax instead of stress them out with quarterly projections and efficiency metrics, so here's your key, room 2412.
