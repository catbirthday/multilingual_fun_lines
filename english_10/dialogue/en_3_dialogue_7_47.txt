=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Have you seen that new Formula 1 documentary series?

Character 2: Drive to Survive? It's brilliant television but terrible journalism. They manufacture rivalries that don't exist and edit radio messages out of sequence to create drama.

Character 1: The sport's grown exponentially since it premiered though.

Character 2: No question—Netflix brought millions of new fans. But now drivers complain about fabricated storylines damaging real relationships. Verstappen refused to participate after they made him look like a villain.

Character 1: What makes a great sports doc in your opinion?

Character 2: Access plus narrative restraint. The Last Dance worked because Jordan finally opened up, but also because they structured it like a thriller. Too many docs just string together talking heads and archival footage.

Character 1: [condescending] Everyone thinks they can make the next Hoop Dreams now.

Character 2: That film took five years following those kids. Most documentarians want quick turnarounds, streaming deals. Real intimacy requires time—watching someone's entire life change through basketball.

Character 1: The Senna documentary still holds up remarkably well.

Character 2: [sad] That footage of his final qualifying lap gets me every time. They built such a complete portrait—the rivalry with Prost, the Brazilian pride, the spiritual searching. It's mythmaking but earned mythmaking.

Character 1: How do you feel about docs that recreate scenes?

Character 2: Depends on transparency. The Alpinist used some recreations brilliantly—you knew exactly what was staged versus authentic. But when docs blur those lines without disclosure, they're breaking fundamental trust with viewers.

Character 1: [laugh] Remember when Icarus accidentally exposed Russian state doping?

Character 2: Started as a cycling experiment, ended up fleeing Moscow with hard drives. That pivot from personal journey to international scandal—you can't script that. Bryan Fogel basically stumbled into a geopolitical thriller.

Character 1: Free Solo made my palms sweat in the theater.

Character 2: [curious] The ethical questions fascinate me more than the climbing. Should filmmakers document something that could kill their subject? They're simultaneously rooting for him and potentially filming his death.

Character 1: Any underrated docs worth finding?

Character 2: When We Were Kings about Ali-Foreman in Zaire. Also, The Two Escobars interweaving Colombian soccer and drug cartels. Both show how sports become proxies for larger cultural tensions.

Character 1: Think we're oversaturated with sports documentaries now?

Character 2: Every league has their own streaming series now, sure. But great stories keep emerging—look at Welcome to Wrexham. The format's elastic enough to handle both billion-dollar franchises and amateur cricket clubs.
