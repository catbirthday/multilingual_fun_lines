Nobody else will give you that kind of brutal honesty, and you need it, even when it, uh, absolutely destroys you at the time."

            "content": "Right right. Look, I get it, I really do. But here's the thing - the pain isn't the point, it's just, uhh, sometimes a byproduct of pushing past your comfort zone, you know? The good mentors know how to balance the tough love with actual support."
