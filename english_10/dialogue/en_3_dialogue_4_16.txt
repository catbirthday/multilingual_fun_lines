=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Excuse me, are you supposed to be sorting the dinosaurs with the action figures or, um, separately?

Character 2: Oh! Actually, I have no idea—this is my first time volunteering here and they kind of just pointed me to this table and said "toys go there," which is, uh, not super helpful when you've got like three thousand toys to organize.

Character 1: Wait, you're the person who brought in that massive truck full of donations earlier?

Character 2: [sniffle] Yeah, that was me. My daughter passed away six months ago and, well, these were all hers—figured they should go to kids who'd actually, you know, play with them instead of just sitting in storage making me cry.

Character 1: Oh my god, I'm... I'm so sorry.

Character 2: [joking] It's okay, really—I mean, not okay okay, but I've discovered that sorting tiny plastic dinosaurs is weirdly therapeutic, so there's that. Plus, she would've absolutely roasted me for keeping all this stuff locked up like some kind of toy dragon hoarding treasure.

Character 1: She sounds like she was pretty funny.

Character 2: Oh man, she was hilarious—eight years old and already doing standup routines at dinner about how I couldn't tell Pokemon apart. "Dad, that's clearly a Charizard, not a dragon, there's literally fire coming out of its tail," she'd say, like I was personally offending the entire Pokemon universe.

Character 1: My son's the same way with his superhero facts.

Character 2: [joking] Let me guess—you've been corrected about Batman's origin story at least, what, seventeen times? Because apparently there's the "movie version" and the "real version" and if you mix them up, you've basically committed a crime against humanity?

Character 1: Yesterday he told me I was "spreading misinformation" about Spider-Man's web shooters.

Character 2: Spreading misinformation! That's amazing. See, this is why I love kids—they're so intensely serious about stuff that, like, objectively doesn't matter, but to them it's everything, and honestly, I kind of miss having someone around to fact-check my Marvel knowledge.

Character 1: Would you, uh, would you want to grab coffee after this? I mean, if that's not weird.

Character 2: [trailing off] That's really sweet, but I should probably... I mean, I'm trying to stay busy these days, keep moving, and after this I've got to...

Character 1: No pressure, seriously. I just thought maybe talking to someone who gets it might help.

Character 2: Wait, you... oh. Oh god, I'm an idiot—that's why you're here too, isn't it? The toys, I mean, they're not just random donations for you either, and here I am going on about my stuff without even asking.

Character 1: My daughter. Car accident, two years ago next month. She was seven.

Character 2: Jesus. I'm so sorry. And yeah, coffee sounds... coffee sounds good actually. There's this place around the corner that does those fancy drinks with way too much whipped cream that kids love—loved—and sometimes I still order them just because.

Character 1: The unicorn frappuccino thing? With all the glitter?

Character 2: Exactly! My daughter called it "liquid magic," which, honestly, for twelve dollars it better be. But yeah, let's go spread some misinformation about superheros over overpriced coffee—I think they would've wanted that.
