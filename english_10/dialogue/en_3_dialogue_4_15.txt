=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: You can't seriously be considering his offer.

Character 2: Why not? Three million for six months of consulting work isn't exactly pocket change. Besides, I'm curious what angle he's really playing here—nobody pays that kind of money without expecting something extraordinary in return.

Character 1: He destroyed your father's company. Remember?

Character 2: Of course I remember. But holding onto old grudges won't bring the company back, will it? Maybe working with him gives me a chance to understand what really happened behind those closed doors.

Character 1: This is insane. You're walking straight into a trap.

Character 2: Probably. But here's the thing—I've spent two years watching from the sidelines while he built his empire on our ruins. If there's even a small chance I can learn something useful, something that matters, shouldn't I take it?

Character 1: And if he figures out who you really are?

Character 2: Then things get interesting. Look, I'm not going in blind here—I've got contingencies, backup plans, the whole nine yards. The question is whether you're going to help me or spend the next hour trying to talk me out of it.

Character 1: He knows. He has to know already.

Character 2: [formal] Perhaps he does, perhaps he doesn't. Either way, declining his invitation would suggest I have something to hide, wouldn't it? Better to play the game with confidence than to reveal weakness through hesitation.

Character 1: You sound exactly like him right now.

Character 2: Good. That means I'm learning. The first rule of defeating your enemy is understanding how they think—and trust me, after studying every deal he's made for the past five years, I'm starting to see the patterns.

Character 1: What if I went instead? As your representative?

Character 2: Absolutely not. He specifically requested me, and sending someone else would be... well, it'd be insulting. Besides, you don't have the technical background to pull off what I'm planning—this needs someone who actually understands the systems.

Character 1: Fine. But I'm going with you.

Character 2: [bored] Sure, if you want to sit in the lobby for six hours reading outdated magazines while I'm in meetings, knock yourself out. Just don't expect him to acknowledge your existence—assistants are basically furniture to people like him.

Character 1: Promise me you'll walk away if it gets dangerous.

Character 2: Define dangerous. Because everything worth doing in this industry comes with risks—hostile takeovers, corporate espionage, regulatory investigations. If I walked away from danger, I'd still be teaching freshman economics at a community college.

Character 1: I mean if he threatens you. Directly threatens you.

Character 2: [regretful] Then I'll leave, yes. Though honestly, after everything that's happened, walking away might be the hardest thing I've ever done. Some opportunities only come once, even if they arrive dressed as disasters.
