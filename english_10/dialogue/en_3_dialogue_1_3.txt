=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: I heard you're retiring after thirty years of teaching.

Character 2: [apologetic] I am, though I feel strange about leaving. You know, when I started teaching, I thought it was temporary—just until I figured out my "real" career. Then somewhere along the way, those kids became my whole world.

Character 1: What made you stay so long?

Character 2: There was this student, Marcus, back in '97. Kid couldn't read at grade level, everyone had written him off. We worked together every lunch period for months, and when he finally got through his first whole book—I knew this was where I belonged.

Character 1: Do you keep in touch with former students?

Character 2: Hundreds of them. Marcus is a pediatrician now, can you believe it? Sarah Chen runs a nonprofit. Tommy Rodriguez became a teacher himself—says I inspired him, though honestly he inspires me more.

Character 1: What's been the hardest part?

Character 2: Watching brilliant kids slip through cracks in the system. You can pour everything into them, stay late, buy supplies with your own money, advocate until you're blue in the face—sometimes it's still not enough.

Character 1: Any regrets?

Character 2: Sure. The field trips I didn't fight harder for, the parents I should've called sooner. But mostly I regret how long it took me to realize that teaching isn't about being perfect—it's about showing up, day after day, believing in them when nobody else does.

Character 1: What about the administration? Were they supportive?

Character 2: [anxious] The principals changed every few years, each with new initiatives and metrics. Some understood that education is about human connection, but others just saw test scores and budgets—those years were brutal.

Character 1: [confused] Wait, you're telling me you bought supplies yourself?

Character 2: Every teacher does. Pencils, notebooks, snacks for hungry kids, winter coats sometimes. My classroom library? Built it book by book from garage sales and my own wallet over three decades.

Character 1: That's thousands of dollars.

Character 2: Probably tens of thousands, honestly. But when Maria comes in without breakfast and you've got granola bars in your desk drawer, you don't think about the money—you think about her being able to focus on fractions instead of hunger.

Character 1: What advice would you give new teachers?

Character 2: Remember why you started. The paperwork will drown you, parents will question you, politicians will blame you—but in that classroom, with those kids, you get to change lives. That's the privilege and the burden we carry.

Character 1: What's next for you?

Character 2: Tutoring at the community center, actually. Can't imagine not teaching—it's like asking me not to breathe. These kids deserve someone who sees their potential, and after thirty years, I've gotten pretty good at seeing what others miss.
