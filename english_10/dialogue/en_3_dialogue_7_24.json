            "content": "Mmm, yeah, several times actually. It's basically just adding more tasks at the same skill level—horizontal expansion, if you want the textbook definition. Though honestly, most companies get it wrong because they think throwing more work at people somehow equals, uh, employee satisfaction."

Reduced their boredom, I suppose, gave them some variety. The metrics improved by about fifteen percent, which, you know, kept management happy enough."

            "content": "Ehh, it wasn't that revolutionary really. We did phased training over six weeks, added tasks gradually so nobody felt overwhelmed. The trick is making sure the new tasks are actually, like, meaningfully different—not just more of the same drudgery wearing a different hat, if that makes sense."

But see, that's the thing most executives miss: it's not really about the money, it's about, er, acknowledging that you're asking for more. Even symbolic increases can work if the communication is handled properly."

            "content": "Hmm, enrichment's theoretically better since you're adding actual decision-making and autonomy, not just... more stuff to do. But it's harder to implement because, well, managers have to give up control, and good luck with that in most corporate cultures, you know?"

They tried to do everything at once—more tasks, more responsibility, new reporting structures—and people just got confused about, uh, what their actual job was anymore. Classic case of too much too fast, I guess."

If it's just boredom, then maybe start small with enlargement, but if you've got genuine engagement issues then, honestly, you probably need to look at deeper structural problems first. Job design is just, like, rearranging deck chairs if the underlying culture is broken."
