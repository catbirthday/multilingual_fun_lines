Character 1: So I've been reading about job enlargement as a way to reduce turnover. You've implemented this before, right?

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, several times actually. It's basically just adding more tasks at the same skill level—horizontal expansion, if you want the textbook definition. Though honestly, most companies get it wrong because they think throwing more work at people somehow equals, uh, employee satisfaction.

Character 1: [warm] But you've seen it work successfully somewhere?

Character 2: Sure, I mean, there was this manufacturing plant where we added quality inspection to the assembly workers' responsibilities. Reduced their boredom, I suppose, gave them some variety. The metrics improved by about fifteen percent, which, you know, kept management happy enough.

Character 1: [very excited] Fifteen percent! That's incredible! How did you structure the transition?

Character 2: Ehh, it wasn't that revolutionary really. We did phased training over six weeks, added tasks gradually so nobody felt overwhelmed. The trick is making sure the new tasks are actually, like, meaningfully different—not just more of the same drudgery wearing a different hat, if that makes sense.

Character 1: [bored] Right, right. And what about resistance from the workers?

Character 2: [singing] Oh there's always resistance at first, la la la, people hate change... Ahem, sorry. Yeah, about forty percent pushed back initially, mostly the senior folks who'd been doing things one way for, gosh, decades probably.

Character 1: How did you overcome that?

Character 2: [empathetically] Well, you have to understand their perspective first, right? These people weren't being difficult just to be difficult—they were genuinely worried about, um, screwing up new responsibilities and looking incompetent after years of being experts at their narrow thing.

Character 1: Did you tie it to compensation increases?

Character 2: Ahh, now that's where it gets tricky. Some places did, some didn't. Truthfully, the ones that didn't usually saw the whole initiative fall apart within, I'd say, eighteen months? People aren't stupid—they know when they're doing more work for the same pay.

Character 1: [confused] Wait, but didn't you just say it was successful at that manufacturing plant?

Character 2: Oh right, yeah, they actually did small bumps—like three to five percent raises, nothing crazy. But see, that's the thing most executives miss: it's not really about the money, it's about, er, acknowledging that you're asking for more. Even symbolic increases can work if the communication is handled properly.

Character 1: What's your take on job enrichment versus enlargement?

Character 2: Hmm, enrichment's theoretically better since you're adding actual decision-making and autonomy, not just... more stuff to do. But it's harder to implement because, well, managers have to give up control, and good luck with that in most corporate cultures, you know?

Character 1: Have you ever seen both implemented simultaneously?

Character 2: Once, at a tech startup, but it was kind of a disaster honestly. They tried to do everything at once—more tasks, more responsibility, new reporting structures—and people just got confused about, uh, what their actual job was anymore. Classic case of too much too fast, I guess.

Character 1: Would you recommend it for my team?

Character 2: Geez, I mean, depends on what problem you're actually trying to solve? If it's just boredom, then maybe start small with enlargement, but if you've got genuine engagement issues then, honestly, you probably need to look at deeper structural problems first. Job design is just, like, rearranging deck chairs if the underlying culture is broken.
