=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Hi, I don't think we've met before. I just moved into 4B last week.

Character 2: Oh hey! Yeah, I'm in 4D, right across the hall actually, and, um, I've been wondering who finally took that unit—it's been empty for like, what, three months? Welcome to the building!

Character 1: Thanks. I'm still getting used to everything here.

Character 2: Mmm, yeah, moving is always rough at first, but honestly this place grows on you—the neighbors are mostly quiet, except for, uh, 3B who plays saxophone at weird hours, but he's actually pretty good so it's kind of nice?

Character 1: Saxophone? That's... unexpected.

Character 2: [whispering] Between you and me, he's apparently some semi-famous jazz musician from the eighties, or at least that's what Mrs. Chen told me, and she's been here forever so, I mean, she'd probably know, right?

Character 1: That's kind of cool actually. Are there any other characters I should know about?

Character 2: Oh man, where do I even start—there's Derek on the first floor who fixes everyone's bikes for free, and then, hmm, the couple in 2A who run that bakery downtown, they sometimes leave extra pastries by people's doors which is, like, dangerously good for my diet.

Character 1: Free pastries? I picked the right building.

Character 2: Right?

Character 1: [cheerful] I'm Maya, by the way. Should've introduced myself earlier!

Character 2: Oh, I'm Sam! And no worries, I literally did the same thing when I moved in—just started rambling about the building before even saying my name, which is, uh, kind of my thing apparently, just ask anyone.

Character 1: How long have you been living here?

Character 2: Gosh, it'll be four years this December, which is weird to think about because it doesn't feel that long, but then again, I've basically watched half the building turn over in that time, so, yeah, I guess I'm one of the old-timers now.

Character 1: Do you like it? I mean, would you recommend staying long-term?

Character 2: Honestly? Yeah, I really do—the location is perfect, rent hasn't gone up too crazy, and there's something about having, you know, actual community with your neighbors that's kind of rare these days, especially in the city.

Character 1: That's exactly what I was hoping for. My last place was so impersonal.

Character 2: [overly polite] Oh, well then you've absolutely made the right choice, and if you need anything at all—seriously, anything—please don't hesitate to knock on my door, I'm usually home evenings and weekends and I'd be more than happy to help however I can.

Character 1: [trailing off] That's really nice of you, I might take you up on that actually, because I still need to figure out...

Character 2: The laundry situation? Yeah, that's, erm, that's a whole thing—you need quarters, specifically, and the change machine is broken half the time, so I usually just grab a roll from the bank once a month and, honestly, I can spot you some until you get sorted.
