=== Dialogue ===

Character 1: Is this seat taken? The café's absolutely packed today.

Character 2: No no, please sit. I've been hogging this whole table for an hour just nursing one coffee. The guilt was starting to get to me actually.

Character 1: [very loudly] Thank god, I've been circling for ten minutes!

Character 2: I saw you doing laps with your laptop bag. Third time past I almost waved you over but thought that might be weird. The lunch rush here is getting absolutely ridiculous lately.

Character 1: You've been here an hour with one coffee?

Character 2: Working on this presentation that's due tomorrow. Well, technically I've been staring at slide fourteen for forty minutes trying to make "synergistic optimization" sound less like corporate nonsense. It's not going well.

Character 1: Synergistic optimization? What does that even mean?

Character 2: Absolutely nothing, that's the problem. My boss loves these buzzwords though. Last week he wanted me to add "paradigm shift" and "blockchain-adjacent thinking" to a report about office supplies.

Character 1: Office supplies and blockchain?

Character 2: Right? I spent three hours trying to connect staplers to cryptocurrency. Eventually wrote something about "distributed ledger methodology for inventory tracking" and he loved it. Sometimes I wonder if anyone actually reads these things.

Character 1: That's completely insane.

Character 2: The worst part is I'm getting good at it. Yesterday I described our new coffee machine as having "AI-enhanced beverage curation capabilities." It just has a timer and five buttons.

Character 1: [confused] Wait, you wrote that about a coffee machine?

Character 2: For the quarterly newsletter. Two full paragraphs about its "user-centric interface" and "sustainable consumption metrics." It counts how many cups you've made, that's literally all it does.

Character 1: How do you sleep at night?

Character 2: Melatonin and white noise mostly. Oh, sometimes I read my own presentations—they're more effective than Ambien. Put myself out cold reading about "leveraging cross-functional initiatives" last Tuesday.

Character 1: You're killing your soul for this job.

Character 2: The soul died somewhere between "thought leadership" and "best-in-class solutions." Now I'm just a hollow vessel that produces PowerPoints. The pay's decent though, and they have good dental.

Character 1: There has to be something better out there.

Character 2: Probably, but quitting requires energy I'm currently spending on making pie charts look revolutionary. Maybe after this presentation I'll update my resume. Or maybe I'll just keep describing printers as having "cutting-edge document manifestation technology."
