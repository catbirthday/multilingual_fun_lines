[laugh] Six months ago, three different surgeons told her she'd never run again. \"Too much damage,\" they said. \"Find a new hobby.\" And she came to me just, um... completely devastated, you know? [empathetically] I mean, running was her entire life. \n\n[confidently] But I kept looking at those scans and thinking, well, there's got to be another way here. The metatarsal stress fractures, yeah, they were bad, but the real issue was, uh... it was the biomechanics. Her whole gait pattern. [passionate] Nobody was looking at the bigger picture! They just saw broken bones and gave up.\n\n[chuckle] God, those first few weeks were rough though. She'd get so frustrated with the exercises—\"How is standing on one foot gonna help me run a marathon?\" [warm] But she trusted me. Even when I wasn't, hmm... even when I wasn't totally sure myself.\n\n[pause] \n\n[very excited] And today she didn't just finish—she PR'd! Her personal best! [laugh loudly] All those doctors who said impossible? I just... wow. [relieved] This is why I do this job. This right here."
