Subject: Winning the broker license exam on the same day your mentor's firm gets investigated for fraud

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [excited] I passed! I actually passed the broker exam, I can't believe— [pause] Wait, are you seeing this? [confused] Turn on the news. No, seriously, turn it on right now. That's... that's Marcus's firm. [very quietly] Oh my God. [pause] Federal investigation for fraud? This is, um... this can't be real. [anxious] He's been my mentor for three years. Three years! Everything I know about this business, he taught me. We were just celebrating last week about how I was gonna join the firm after I got licensed, and now... [sigh] I mean, what does this even mean for me? [upset] My whole resume is basically "trained under Marcus Chen." That's what got me interviews. [pause] Shit. Am I tainted by association now? Like, will people think I'm, uh... that I knew something? [very sad] I didn't know anything. I studied so hard for this exam, genuinely worked my ass off, and now it's all just... [trailing off] I don't know. [bitter] The one day that should've been pure celebration, right? [long pause] Maybe I should've seen signs. Actually, thinking back, there were some weird things he'd say about, um, about client accounts. [regretful] God, I feel so stupid.
