Subject: Your peasant family's land is being bought by developers for enough money to change your life, but it's been home for generations

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: Three million. [pause] Three million euros for this old patch of dirt that my grandfather's grandfather broke his back over. [bitter] And they want an answer by Friday. [laughs] I keep walking around touching things like... like I'm trying to memorize them, you know? [sad] The stone wall Papa built when I was seven, where we'd sit and eat lunch during harvest. [sniffle] That crooked olive tree that, um... that Mama said was planted the day her grandmother was born. [very quietly] How do you put a price on that? [pause] But then I think about Marco's medical bills and, ugh, Sofia needing proper schooling and— [frustrated] God, we could actually afford things! [anxious] Real doctors, not just hoping the fever breaks. [shaky voice] We could fix the roof without choosing between that and eating meat this winter. [crying while speaking] But it feels like I'm... I'm selling their ghosts, you know? [sigh] Papa would understand, I think. [hesitantly] He always said the land serves the family, not the other way around, but... [trailing off] I don't know, maybe that's just what I need to tell myself. [very sad] They'll build some shopping center or apartments or whatever and nobody will even know we existed here for two hundred years. [whisper] Three million though.
