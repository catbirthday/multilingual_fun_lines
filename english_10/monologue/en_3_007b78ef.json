When she first walked in here, she was just... broken. Like completely broken. [warm] And now look at her. [pause] I remember that first day, she couldn't even make eye contact, she was shaking so bad. And I thought, um, I honestly thought we might lose her, you know? [emotional] But she kept coming back. Every single day, she showed up. Even when she was sick, even when she relapsed that one time and had to start over. [sniffle] God, and her kids— she used to cry about them constantly. [very sad] The guilt was eating her alive. She'd show me their pictures on that cracked phone of hers, telling me their birthdays, what they liked at school. [pause] And now they're home. They're actually home with her. [extremely happy] She sent me a photo of them all having pizza last night, just a normal Tuesday night dinner, and I just— [cry] I'm sorry, I know I'm supposed to stay professional, but this is why I do this job. This right here. Two years clean. Her babies back where they belong. [warm] Some days in this work are so hard, but today? Today is a good day."
