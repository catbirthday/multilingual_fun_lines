[angry] Before I spent every weekend in that workshop, before I missed my sister's wedding to finish that commission, before I— [sigh] [upset] God, I can still smell the sawdust on my clothes. [very sad] Maybe he's right though. [hesitantly] Maybe I've been fooling myself this whole time. [anxious] I mean, my joints never fit perfectly on the first try like Marcus's do.
