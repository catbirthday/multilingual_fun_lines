Subject: Your gold digger reputation was wrong - you genuinely loved them and they finally believe it

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [relieved] You actually believe me. After all this time, you finally... God, I can't even describe what this feels like. [shaky voice] Do you know how many nights I've stayed awake, just... replaying every conversation where you'd look at me with that doubt in your eyes? Like I was some kind of, I don't know, predator or something. [sniffle] And I'd try to explain—I'd try so hard to make you understand that it was never about the money. Never. But you'd already made up your mind about me, hadn't you? Because of what your friends said, what your family thought. [bitter] "She's just after your bank account, she doesn't really care about you." [pause] And the worst part? Hmm, the worst part was that I couldn't even blame you for thinking it. I mean, I get it—I came from nothing, you had everything. It looked... suspicious, I guess. [very quietly] But I loved you from that first stupid conversation we had about, um, about whether hot dogs were sandwiches. [laugh] Remember that? You were so passionate about something so ridiculous, and I just thought... this person is special. [crying while speaking] And now you believe me. You actually believe that I'd have loved you if you were broke, if you had nothing, if we had to live in that tiny apartment I had when we met. [warm] Because I would have. I really, really would have.
