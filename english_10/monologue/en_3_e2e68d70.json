I mean, I am happy, I'm—I'm thrilled, obviously. She worked so hard. [bitter] But it's just... mmm, I don't know how to explain this without sounding like a complete asshole. [sigh] Like, I had better grades than her. Better test scores. More research experience. And they still said no to me. Twice. [quietly] And she just waltzes in on her first try. [pause] I keep thinking maybe there was something fundamentally wrong with my application, you know? Or maybe, um... maybe something wrong with me. [shaky voice] And now I have to go to her celebration dinner tonight and smile and... and act like I'm not dying inside. [laugh] Ha. Listen to me. Twenty-eight years old and jealous of my baby sister. [sad] I really wanted this. I wanted it so badly. And watching her get it is just... oof. [sniffle] I'll be fine. I'll figure out how to be the supportive big sister. I just need, uh... I just need a minute first."
