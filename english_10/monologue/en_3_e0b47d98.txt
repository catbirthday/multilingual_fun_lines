Subject: The luthier guitar you spent eight months crafting just brought tears to the musician's eyes when they played it

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shaky voice] Oh my God. They're actually crying. Eight months and I... I wasn't sure if it would even—wow. [short pause] Did you see how their hands just, like, trembled when they played that first chord? I mean, I knew the resonance was good, but hearing it in someone else's hands is completely different. [warm] All those nights staying up late, obsessing over the grain pattern, wondering if I was being too precious about the bracing... [laugh] My wife kept saying I was going insane, you know? Like, "it's just wood and strings." But it's not—it's never just that. [pause] When they played that melody, the one they wrote for their daughter... [sniffle] God, I'm gonna cry too. You spend so long wondering if anyone will really hear what you put into it. All those hours with the chisels, the, um... the endless sanding until my fingers went numb. [quietly] And then someone picks it up and just... understands. [emotional] That's why we do this, right? Not for the money—God knows there's no money in this. [chuckle] But for that moment when the wood comes alive and someone's whole face just... transforms. [very sincerely] Eight months. Worth every single second.
