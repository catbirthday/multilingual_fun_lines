=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [anxious] So Sarah called today with her news and I... God, I should be happy for her, right? Five years sober, that's—that's huge. [pause] And she's having this whole party next weekend, renting out that restaurant downtown, the nice one with the, um... with the rooftop thing. [bitter] Meanwhile we're over here trying to figure out if we can keep the electricity on next month. [sigh] 

I mean, I am happy for her. [quietly] I really am. It's just, ugh, the timing of it all, you know? She's talking about her promotion and the vacation they're planning, and I'm sitting there calculating if we have enough gas money to even make it to her party. [frustrated] Which we have to go to, obviously. Can't miss that.

[shaky voice] Tom lost another contract yesterday. That's three this month. And here's his sister calling about champagne toasts—well, sparkling cider for her—and I just... [pause] I wanted to scream. Or cry. Maybe both.

[warm] But then she said something about how we inspired her, how seeing us stick together through everything made her believe she could beat this. [crying while speaking] And now I feel like such a terrible person for even thinking these things.
