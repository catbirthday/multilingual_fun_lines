Subject: Your immigrant neighbor asking you to be their citizenship ceremony witness because you helped them practice English

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [nervous] So, um, I have something to ask you and it's... it's kind of big actually. [clearing throat] You know how my citizenship ceremony is next month? Well, they said I can bring, uh, a witness. Someone important to me. [pause] And I was thinking... would you maybe want to be that person? [hopeful] I mean, you don't have to, obviously, but the thing is—when I first moved here, I couldn't even order coffee without writing it down first. [laugh] Remember? You were so patient with me. Every Tuesday, sitting on your porch, helping me with, what did you call them... idioms? [warm] "It's raining cats and dogs." I thought you were crazy! [chuckle] But you never made me feel stupid, you know? Not once. [emotional] And now I can—I can argue with the cable company in English! [laugh] That's because of you. [shaky voice] My family, they're all back home, so... I don't know, it would mean everything if you could be there. [pause] You're the one who helped me find my voice here. Literally. [very sincerely] So, um, would you? Would you be my witness?
