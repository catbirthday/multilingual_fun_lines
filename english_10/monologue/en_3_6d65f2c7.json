[pause] The letter's just sitting here on my kitchen table, next to Mom's second job schedule and Dad's medication bottles. [bitter] Four years, all expenses paid, to a place we couldn't even afford to drive to for the tour. [laugh] I told them over dinner and Mom just... she started crying. Happy tears, she said, but I could see it, you know? That look. [very sad] Like I'm already gone. Like I'm already someone they don't recognize. [sigh] Dad asked if they have visiting hours, like it's a prison or something. I didn't have the heart to tell him that parents' weekend costs more than our rent. [frustrated] And everyone at school keeps saying how lucky I am, how amazing this opportunity is, and they're right, they're absolutely right, but it's also kind of, um... it's terrifying? [shaky voice] Because once I go there, once I cross into that world, I don't know if I can ever really come back here. Not in the same way. [long pause] But I have to go. [very slowly] I worked too hard not to go. Even if it means leaving everything behind."
