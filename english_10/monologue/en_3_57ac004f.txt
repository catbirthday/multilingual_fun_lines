=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [bitter] You know what? I'd do it again. [pause] Even knowing how it all turned out, I'd still... yeah. I'd still stop Jake from investing Dad's retirement money in that crypto thing. [sigh] God, the way he looked at me when I called the bank. Like I'd—like I'd betrayed him or something. But what was I supposed to do, you know? Just let him throw away everything? Mom was already sick, we needed that money for her treatment, and he was just going to, um... going to gamble it all on some internet coin because his buddy promised him it'd triple. [very quietly] He hasn't spoken to me in two years. [regretful] Two years. My little brother won't even... won't return my texts. [frustrated] And the thing is, that crypto? It crashed three weeks later. Completely worthless. So yeah, I saved us from losing the house, saved Mom's treatment fund, but I lost—hmm, I lost him. [sad] Sometimes I wonder if maybe I should've, I don't know, handled it differently? Found another way? But then I remember Mom crying about the medical bills and... [slowly] no. No, I did what I had to do. Even if it means he'll never forgive me.
