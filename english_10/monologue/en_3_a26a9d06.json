[relieved] Oh my god, this changes everything. [pause] I was looking at the Martinez family's file and I realized they qualify for the expanded coverage—they've been paying out of pocket for their daughter's asthma medication this whole time. [speaking fast] And the Nguyens, they're eligible for the dental program. The kids can get braces. Mrs. Chen's diabetes supplies? Covered. Completely covered. [emotional] These families have been struggling and they didn't even know there was help available. [sniffle] I keep thinking about all those declined prescriptions, all those, um... all those appointments they canceled because they couldn't afford the copay. [passionately] But now I can fix this. I can actually help them navigate this mess of a system. [laugh] God, I used to hate this software so much, but now it's like—it's like I've got the keys to unlock something real for people. [determined] Tomorrow I'm calling every single family on my list. Every one. They deserve to know what they're entitled to. [warm] This is why I took this job. This is exactly why."
