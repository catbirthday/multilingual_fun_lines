Subject: Your immigrant neighbor asking you to be their citizenship ceremony witness because you helped them practice English

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: I have something to ask you and, um... I've been standing outside your door for maybe five minutes trying to figure out how to say this. [nervous] You know how next month is my citizenship ceremony? [pause] Well, they said I can bring witness—someone who knows me, who has been part of my journey here. [hesitantly] And I was wondering if maybe you would... would you come? [very meekly] I know it's big thing to ask. [quickly] But you remember when I first moved here, my English was so terrible—I couldn't even order coffee without pointing at menu! [chuckle] And you never made me feel stupid, you know? [warm] Every Tuesday, you sat with me on your porch, helping me practice pronunciation. [emotional] "The weather is nice today"—you made me say it hundred times until I stopped saying "wezzer." [laugh] My kids, they laugh at me because I still hear your voice in my head when I speak. [smiling speaking] "Remember, it's TH not Z!" [trailing off] The truth is, errr... you taught me more than English. [pause] You taught me I belonged here. [sniffle] When I failed driver test three times, you said "Americans fail it too," and somehow that made everything better. [relieved] So I thought, who else would I want there when I become American? [very sincerely] It has to be you. [shaky voice] You were my first real friend here, and... oh, I'm getting all emotional now. [laugh softly] Would you please be my witness?
