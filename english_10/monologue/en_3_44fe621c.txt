Subject: Your receptionist kindness being mentioned in a customer's letter to corporate about exceptional service

=== Dialogue ===

Speaker: [shocked] Wait, someone wrote a letter? About me? To corporate? 

[pause] 

Oh my God, I just... wow. I mean, I remember Mrs. Henderson, she came in last month and she was, um... she was having such a rough day. Her husband had just been diagnosed and she couldn't figure out the insurance forms and I just—I just sat with her, you know? 

[warm] That's literally all I did. 

I made her some tea from my desk drawer stash and we went through everything together. She was crying and I was trying not to cry and... 

[sigh] 

[getting emotional] I had no idea she'd, uh... that she'd actually write to corporate about it. 

[laugh] 

People usually only write when they're mad, right? But she said I was—hang on, let me read it again—"extraordinarily kind" and that I "restored her faith in humanity." 

[crying while speaking] That's so... I can't even...

[sniffle]

[very quietly] I was just doing my job. Well, okay, maybe a little more than my job but... I don't know, when someone needs help, you help them. That's what we're here for, right? 

[warm] God, this made my whole week. My whole year actually.
