I mean, actually perfect. [proudly] Not a single bubble, no cold shuts, the surface finish is like—it's like glass, kid. \n\n[emotional] You know, I've been doing this for, what, thirty-two years? And I still remember my first perfect casting. My mentor, old Frank, he just stood there and, um... he didn't say anything for the longest time. [chuckle] Then he goes \"Well, guess you're not completely hopeless after all.\"\n\n[warmly] But you—you've got something special. The way you adjusted the temperature when you felt it wasn't quite right? That's instinct. Can't teach that, really. I watched you pause, hmm, recalculate, and then just... nail it. \n\n[very sincerely] I'm proud of you. Really proud. This piece right here? This is the moment everything changes. From now on, you're not learning how to do it—you're, uh, you're refining what you already know. [pause] Man, I'm getting all sentimental here but... this is why I teach. For moments like this. [happy] Your first perfect piece. Remember this feeling, alright?"
