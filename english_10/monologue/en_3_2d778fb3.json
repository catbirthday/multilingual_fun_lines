[bitter] Every single location, just... done. [pause] You know what's funny? I actually thought this was gonna be my thing. [regretful] Like, I had this whole plan, right? Get certified, work at Strike Zone, eventually open my own pro shop maybe. [very sad] And the certification wasn't cheap either—two grand, plus all those weekends in Columbus for the training. [upset] My wife said I was being ridiculous, spending that much on, um... on drilling holes in bowling balls. [laugh] But I was good at it! [passionately] Really good. The weight blocks, the pin placements, understanding someone's release and matching it to the right layout—[trailing off] it's actually pretty complex... [pause] Now what am I supposed to do? [anxious] There's like, what, maybe two independent alleys left in the whole state? And they've already got their guys. [bitter] Nobody needs a certified driller when there's nowhere left to bowl. [very quietly] I keep looking at my certification on the wall and it's just... [sigh] it's basically a two-thousand-dollar piece of paper now. [confused] How does an entire chain just disappear like that? Sixty locations to nothing. [very sad] God, what a waste."
