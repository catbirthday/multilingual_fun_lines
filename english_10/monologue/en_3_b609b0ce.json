[relieved] The Meridian Glory, she's finally docked, all nine hundred feet of her. When those forty-foot swells started hitting us sideways, I thought... [pause] I mean, you train for this stuff, right? But when you're actually up there on the bridge, and the captain's looking at you like you're the only thing between his ship and the rocks, it's, um, it's different. [shaky voice] Container ships that size don't exactly turn on a dime, you know? [nervous laugh] And the channel narrows right where the current gets nasty, which is— I kept thinking about the Evermore incident from 2019. [anxious] Same conditions, smaller ship, and they still scraped bottom. But we threaded it. [slowly] Every correction had to be perfect, had to anticipate the wind pushing us before it actually did. [excited] The crew was incredible though, I mean they executed every command instantly. [pause] My dad piloted ships through here for thirty years. [warm] Never brought in anything close to this size. I wish he could've seen it. [proudly] We just made history out there. The Meridian Glory, largest vessel ever to navigate the harbor in storm conditions. [exhausted] I need a drink. Or five."
