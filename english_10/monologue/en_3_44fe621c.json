I mean, I remember Mrs. Henderson, she came in last month and she was, um... she was having such a rough day. Her husband had just been diagnosed and she couldn't figure out the insurance forms and I just—I just sat with her, you know? \n\n[warm] That's literally all I did. \n\nI made her some tea from my desk drawer stash and we went through everything together. She was crying and I was trying not to cry and... \n\n[sigh] \n\n[getting emotional] I had no idea she'd, uh... that she'd actually write to corporate about it. \n\n[laugh] \n\nPeople usually only write when they're mad, right? But she said I was—hang on, let me read it again—\"extraordinarily kind\" and that I \"restored her faith in humanity.\" \n\n[crying while speaking] That's so... I can't even...\n\n[sniffle]\n\n[very quietly] I was just doing my job. Well, okay, maybe a little more than my job but... I don't know, when someone needs help, you help them. That's what we're here for, right? \n\n[warm] God, this made my whole week. My whole year actually."
